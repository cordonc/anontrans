                                        Paul Gilmartin on the podcast "Mental Illness Happy Hour". It is a weekly
                                        hour-long audio podcast consisting of interviews with artists, friends, and the
                                        occasional doctor. It is geared toward anyone interestd in or affect by
                                        depression, addiction, and other mental challenges which are so prevalent in the

                                        in the media today. The Michael Jackson thing and the Catholic priests. It’s all
                                        over everywhere. It’s also become such a cliché in terms of like TV movies and
                                        just Hollywood dramas. There’s just sort of like “Oh, I was abused as a child”
                                        and the violins start playing. But you don’t have any kind of empathy for what
                                        these kids have actually gone through and the emotional aftermath of what’s
                                        happened to them.”

                                <element class="speaker">Paul:</element>One of the things that I like to talk about, if
                                you're
                                comfortable talking about it, is the manner in which these predators get their way. What
                                they say, how
                                they act, how they groom people. I want to understand more of how they get away with it.
                                I guess in the
                                hopes that someday maybe there can be a telltale warning signs that we can share with
                                children, beware
                                if this starts happening. If this happens, this is not okay, even though it may be
                                exciting to you. Are
                                you comfortable talking about the details?

                                <element class="speaker">Sophie:</element>Yea, so it started off in this theater arts
                                troupe and when
                                you do like a theater production, everyone gets really close really fast. You're working
                                together like
                                everyday.

                                <element class="speaker">P:</element>And it's exciting and the bonding is like you being
                                yourself and
                                you're letting your freak flag fly, you're being expressive, you're not being judged.

                                <element class="speaker">S:</element> Yea, so after, I mean we all felt really close to
                                each other, but it wasn't a real closeness, because it's not something you build up
                                overtime it's kind of superficial, but I was feeling comfortable with everyone and I
                                sort of admired him anyway and we exchanged screen names, this is back in the day when
                                you do the AOL instant messenger and so we started talking online and I felt safe with
                                him and he treated me like an equal. Like he didn't treat me like a child and I think
                                that's something that people, children need to look out for and it's hard to recognize
                                because you want to be treated equally when you're young especially when you're around
                                that age, 12 or 13, you want to be treated as an adult.

                                that age difference.

                                one on one and then I would sneak out of my house and he would come pick me up and take
                                me back to his apartment. At the time, I thought it was a real relationship, I know now
                                it wasn't. And even for years after that I always saw it as a great thing, a great

                                that was very harmful to me.

                                it was all a lie. And it really sort of cut me down to size.

                                if I saw him today, I don't know if I'd punch him in the face or hug him. You know,
                                there's still that part of me that remembers thinking that I was totally in love with
                                him, so that's really hard to deal with, knowing it was abuse and still having that
                                tenderness for him. You know it's really shocking and upsetting to me.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paul">
                                <element class="speaker">P:</element>Thank you for sharing that part of it, because I
                                think that's one of the most difficult things in confronting the abuse that happened to
                                you, to us, is that its so complicated because there are often positive feelings towards
                                the abuser and you feel like you're throwing them under the bus to call them a predator
                                or whatever. Because we do often see that humanity, but then we also think to ourselves,
                                was it all an act? But my thought is that, I don't think there can be genuine tenderness
                                between somebody who is in the state of abusing somebody, to me it all falls under the
                                heading of grooming and mind control. I think.. I don't know that's just my personal
                                opinion, but getting back to the time that you spent with him, like what would he say to
                                you to introduce the physical aspect?
                        </p>

                                <element class="speaker">S:</element>Well, I think and this is something that's really
                                difficult for me to swallow, is that I think I instigated it. If he was so smart
                                grooming me that you know I thought I was in charge of the situation and then we started
                                talking online and I don't remember if I brought it up or if he brought it up, like 'oh,
                                come pick me up.'
                        </p>

                                him, from the moment that he began an email relationship with you that was beyond maybe
                                just 'hey I'm having trouble with this part, can I email you?' 'yea sure' you know, like
                                I get emails sometimes from girls who are 15 years old and they're like 'I'm cutting, I
                                don't know what to do' Well clearly, I'm going to email them back and say go see a
                                therapist or whatever, but I think there's a qualification to a relationship with
                                somebody who is age inappropriate on the internet and to me it just sounds like this
                                guy, right out of the gate, he knew what he wanted. Who was the one who suggested that
                                you started corresponding via email?

                                came out of no where and that's something thats really hard to deal with. Like, where

                        <h6>Beau-père, <br> 1981</h6>
                        <h4>After her mother dies, fourteen-year-old Marion falls in love with her stepfather, Remy. Rémi (Patrick Dewaere) is a
                                man trapped in a deteriorating marriage. When his wife is unexpectedly killed in a car accident, Rémi is left
                                with his stepdaughter, Marion (Ariel Besse), who chooses to stay with him rather than live with her birth
                                father. After the initial shock passes, Rémi is caught off-guard when the 14-year-old Marion begins expressing
                                her attraction to him. Initially repulsed, Marion's mature beauty wears him down as he finally caves to her
                                seductions.<br><br> Writer and director Bertrand Blier declared Beau Pere was intended as "an ode to the fair
                                sex and to womanhood in its purest form." Like Blier's earlier film Going Places (1974), he based it on a novel
                                he had written, also titled Beau-père.</h4>

                                campaign to seduce him. ‘Beau Pere’ is a delicious French pastry. It simmers gently with wit and irony.”<br>

                        <h4>Paul Wyler is a successful sculptor best known for sculpting nude young girls. When he encounters an old flame, Sarah, he is so smitten by her beautiful daughter Laura that he asks Sarah if she will pose for him. Sarah, married but still jealous of the fact that her former lover is more attracted to her daughter, tells Paul that Laura is not interested, even though she is actually quite enthusiastic about doing it. As an alternative to live posing, Sarah takes photos of Laura posing nude and gives them to Paul so that he can sculpt Laura. After a fire at an art exhibit, Paul goes blind and cannot complete the sculpture. In the end, Laura, when going to say goodbye to Paul, allows him to finish his work by feeling her body and sculpting by feeling. This leads to a sexual encounter between the two, and the next morning Laura's mother comes to take her away.</h4>

                        <h4>Reviews:<br><br>
                        
                                The Lover, a sophisticated adaptation of Marguerite Duras’ bestselling memoir about her love affair as a 15-year-old with a rich, older Chinese man, lacks the distinctive voice and ambiance of the book, but the abundant sex – soft-core and tasteful – and the splendid sets make up for the film’s banal style.<br><br>

No expense has been spared – the film cost $22 million – in Jean-Jacques Annaud’s evocation of the pungent atmosphere of the story’s 1920s Vietnam setting.<br><br>

Part of the fault lies with Jane March, a pretty 17-year-old English actress who plays the young Duras. She pouts to perfection but does not convey the jaded spirit of the girl. Tony Leung is excellent as the shiftless scion whose love for the girl makes him emotionally naked and vulnerable.<br><br>

In the film’s well-handled subplot, Frederique Meininger is superb as the girl’s exhausted schoolteacher mother. Most powerful scene deals with the mother’s farewell to her son (Arnaud Giovaninetti), who is being sent back to France.<br><br>

                                <element class="speaker">Jess:</element>My sister went first. She turned ten first.
                                She’s a couple of years older than me, so she went to go live with my mother and
                                stepfather and then I moved out there when I was ten. My father actually threatened my
                                stepmother’s child once cuz she was being mad that she was gonna be sent to go live with
                                my mother and stepfather, which I thought was funny because she doesn’t know them. So I
                                went to—I moved to San Francisco and you know I was a miserable child. I was throwing up
                                every night still and I had no friends, I had no ability to make friends, I had never
                                had a friend in my life. I didn’t have a friend until I was a sophomore in high school,
                                I just didn’t allow people near me. And then I joined up—my brother and sister were
                                already going to this karate school and it was the first time I had experienced value
                                because I would go to this karate school and people thought, you know, it was cute,
                                there was this little kid, I was eleven years old, ten or eleven, and I was doing karate
                                and I was really thriving in it and I was like getting up there in the belts and going
                                to tournaments. At the karate school there were just—the karate studio was made up—the
                                majority were men, older men, like 20’s and 30’s.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paul">
                                <element class="speaker">P:</element>I don't like where this is going.
                        </p>
                        <p class="guest">
                                <element class="speaker">J:</element>You’re not going to. So 20’s, 30’s. There was woman
                                there that was the wife of the main guy and I just idealized her. She was so cool to me.
                                I found out later on that she was actually the victim of domestic violence from the main
                                guy. So I started hanging out every day, you know. It was the only sense of—I felt like
                                a family with these people, they cared about me. All the while kind of realizing there
                                was an element a little off there, you know. A lot of these older men were very—clients
                                would come in, like customers, karate people would come in and they would be very
                                flirtatious, very sexual, saying sexual things in the office after these women would
                                leave. And there were things called private lessons, you know, where like you would go
                                in the back and do a karate lesson. And so I’m working there, you know, I’m there like
                                six days a week. I’m cleaning the floors, cleaning the windows, you know, I’d become
                                like the mascot. Then I get to a certain level and I start teaching private lessons.
                                Which would be to the adults, I would teach them—I’m eleven at this point and I’m
                                teaching them the basics of karate, you know, all the while I’m discovering, because I’m
                                11 or 12, I’m discovering my sexuality. You know, I’m discovering I can get attention if
                                I maybe wear a small shirt under my karate uniform. Or, you know, it was the only form
                                of attention that I’d ever really received, so I just went for it. You know, and I
                                played up the idea of being the Lolita and the truth is that if you challenge enough
                                men, odds are that one will bite, you know.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paul">
                                <element class="speaker">P:</element>And I think probably those men don’t realize that
                                the 12-year-old you had a really innocent idea of what sex and flirtation is. That she
                                doesn’t know what she’s getting into, she doesn’t know what kind of a trap she’s
                                setting. She doesn’t know what she’s going to catch. She thinks she’s going to get
                                attention and maybe a little bit—I mean you weren’t hoping to become sexual with these
                                people, were you? You just wanted …
                        </p>
                        <p class="guest">
                                <element class="speaker">J:</element>Well, I think this is where it gets really, really
                                shady. And this is where a lot of people that might be listening might get upset,
                                because I still hold to the belief that when I was that young I absolutely wanted to be
                                sexual and I absolutely knew what I was doing because I was—I just learned so early how
                                to manipulate the situation because I needed to to survive. I needed to know how to read
                                people and I needed to know how to work people. And if that meant I was going to get
                                attention and survive, because I was being seen, you know, it didn’t matter how I was
                                being seen. If I was being seen, I was gonna survive. So if it meant I was gonna be
                                sexual or be you know, overtly sexual to these older men, fine.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paul">
                                <element class="speaker">P:</element> But my point too Jess is that the 12-year-old’s
                                version of what being sexual is going to encompass is going to be different than what an
                                adult who has already lived and experienced that knows. So that child still, even though
                                they may want that thing, is still that adult should know that and see that and not
                                engage that because they know that child doesn’t know what they’re getting into to.
                        </p>


                        <p class="guest">
                                <element class="speaker">J:</element>Absolutely. That’s, I mean, that I agree with. You
                                know, years into my
                                recovery I had a friend of mine say to me once, “All right, Jess. I want you to go on
                                the Internet right now and
                                I want you to find one 12-year-old boy, one, that you find attractive, one.” You know,
                                and as soon as she said
                                that I realized I was looking through it through an older person’s eyes. It’s insane,
                                you know. And you know I
                                just—like I said, you play the odds enough, you know, and the person that I ended up
                                having these intimate
                                relations with,

                                he was a 27-year-old ex-Marine and God only knows what he had been through and what he
                                had seen and what he had
                                done already, you know, overseas, he went to the first Gulf War and so he came in as a
                                student. I was teaching
                                him, and, you know, over the next year and a half, we started spending time together and
                                the part that always
                                got me was that my mother and stepfather had no problem with me spending time, as much
                                as I did then.
                        </p>

                                <element class="speaker">P:</element>That’s the part that makes my fucking jaw drop.
                                Talk about—you told the story about him coming to pick you up for a fucking date and
                                your mom and stepdad signing off on that.
                        </p>

                        <p class="guest">
                                <element class="speaker">J:</element>Well my stepdad was already back in New Orleans and
                                my mother, my mother at that time was then into, I’m pretty sure she was into pill
                                addiction at that time. And also when I asked her about it, she said, “If I had any
                                idea, you know, all I knew is that you were happy. That’s the only time you were happy,”
                                you know. And for that, I just need to let that go, you know, it was—I don’t know it’s
                                really—I swear it felt like what I thought dating would be. You know, I would go and I
                                would spend hours there with him.

                                <element class="speaker">P:</element>I’m sure the attention was electric. Because not
                                only was it attention from a guy, it was attention from a 27-year-old guy, which is got
                                explode a 12-year-old’s ego.

                                <element class="speaker">J:</element>It was pretty wild you know. We never had actual
                                sex, we had, well, you know, full on sex. We had different forms, and yeah, you know, it
                                was, in a 12-year-old’s mind we were dating.

                                Were they confusing? Were they good and bad? Was it all bad?

                                was—I’m amazed no one at the studio knew. Everyone claims they didn’t know. You know,
                                but there was someone living with him at the time, another teacher at the studio, and
                                how he didn’t know is beyond me. You know, because I would be spending the whole day on
                                the weekends there, you know.

                                where he picks me up and gives my mom a bottle of wine or champagne or something and me
                                a rose and we go on a date, and then I move back to New Orleans. And then–

                                only was I being taken away from the one place that I felt like was a home, as twisted
                                as it was, you know, I was already fully addicted to this person. This was a man that
                                pleased me on a level I had never been pleased, and also you know was giving me this
                                attention, and what was I going to do without him? You know, it was a total setup for
                                the rest of, you know, my relationships. And so when I found, you know, when I found out
                                we were moving I was devastated. And when we did move I just flipped out, you know, and
                                I remembered when things started changing for the worse because I made him a necklace
                                and I sent it to him and I calld him and I said, “Hey, did you get the necklace?” and he
                                said, “Oh, yeah, your cute little necklace. Yeah, it broke in the mail.” You know, and I
                                realized at that point he was treating me like a kid, because he hadn’t treated me like
                                a kid before.

                        <p class="guest">
                                <element class="speaker">J:</element> You know, I mean like not a good person to keep a
                                secret. So she goes to my mother and then it becomes like a domino affect. My mother
                                calls California. I’m finding out—and I’m just finding things out through hearsay. I’m
                                afraid to ask anyone, you know, all of the sudden my mother is just so upset. My mother
                                is like, “How could this happen? How could you do this to my baby?” You know, all these
                                things, and in my opinion it was just like this embarrassment, how could people find out
                                you know, that I had fucked up as a mother. What I’m hearing from the grapevine is that
                                this person, this man that I had been involved with not only got his ass royally kicked
                                by all of the instructors, but lost his house, lost his job, I’m not sure why charges
                                weren’t pressed, I’m really not sure. But I was just, there was nothing I could do. And
                                I felt completely powerless and devastated and no one wanted to speak with me again, no
                                one from that entire place and that was crushing because that was the only connection
                                that I had ever really made and so what I basically learned—
                        </p>
                        <p class="paul">
                                <element class="speaker">P:</element>Why would they punish you?
                        </p>
                        <p class="guest">
                                <element class="speaker">J:</element> Because I was trouble. I was now labeled as
                                trouble, you know. And, yeah, it really sucked, because I really cared for these people,
                                but they—I was branded. And I didn’t hear anything for years, a couple of years went by
                                and then I got—my mother came up to me with the phone one night and said, “You better
                                not fucking lie to them.” And I said, “Who?” I answered the phone and it was the
                                California Highway Police and this—the police were calling to confirm that this guy had
                                molested me and I was like, “What? Whoa? What’s going on here?” And he was applying for
                                a California Highway Police job. So apparently it’s somewhere in the books, and you
                                know, I felt like I had ruined his life twice. It was like re-traumatizing you know and
                                nowhere in there was there really support for me, you know, I’m trying to make sure
                                everyone else is fine, so you know, I tell these stories and I don’t want to sound like
                                a super victim because I don’t really feel like a victim anymore, but it does sound kind
                                of shitty these things.

                                old girl aside and said, you know, “Let’s talk about what you’re feeling, let’s talk
                                about, you know, how desperately you want attention, and let’s show her that there are
                                healthy ways for a 12-year-old girl to get attention. And let’s see that she has an
                                outlet for her feelings and her creativities and her desires so that she doesn’t have to

                                template of, ok, so from now on my sexuality and my dating is going to be secret, I’m
                                not gonna tell anyone. They’re gonna continue to be older because I’m gonna try and
                                relive this situation and make it work out for me, you know, but also reliving the
                                situation of my father sending me away, like changing that, fixing that, like, pick me
                                instead of my stepmother, you know, like. So I mean just this deep template being set
                                down and then the second part of the story is, you know, after—flash forward, I’m 28
                                years old and in San Francisco because I’m applying to graduate schools for therapy,
                                marriage and family therapy, and I’m with my aunts, a couple of my aunts who, you know,
                                over my adulthood, they’ve become my real core, you know, of family, and we’re in a San
                                Francisco supermarket and I walk in and I turn my head to the right and I see the back
                                of this man’s head and there is a scar on it, and the shape of the head and the shape of
                                the hair, and I realize it’s the man, the karate guy that I was involved with when I was

                                blame, and the truth is I fully believe that I had a part in it. I don’t believe it was

                                many times on the podcast that most of the stuff that fucks us up is stuff that’s in a

                                through that gray area, wanting to know where the truth is, wanting some type of
                                catharsis and sometimes it’s really hard with stuff that’s in the gray area and this is

                                through the issue and I’m not a full victim, you know and I felt awful about what
                                happened to him. And I still do to a certain extent—I don’t feel that awful but I feel,
                                you know, I feel sad for him.

                <h6>Sexual Morality and the Law</h6>
                <h3>April 4th, 1978</h3>
                <h3> Sexual Morality and the Law is the transcription of a 1978 radio conversation in Paris between philosopher Michel Foucault, playwright/actor/lawyer Jean Danet, and novelist/gay activist Guy Hocquenghem, debating the idea of abolishing age of consent laws in France. </h3>

                <p>In 1977, the issue was brought to public attention in France by a petition against age of consent laws addressed to the Parliament, defending the decriminalization of all consented sexual relations between adults and minors below the age of fifteen (the age of consent in France ). Foucault stated that the petition was signed by several philosophers including Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Louis Althusser, pediatrician and psychoanalyst Françoise Dolto, and also by people Foucault described as belonging to a wide range of political positions.<br><br>

                        The dialogue was broadcast on April 4, 1978 by radio France Culture. It was originally published in French as La loi de la pudeur [literally, "The law of decency"] and reprinted in English as The Danger of Child Sexuality. The text was later included under the title Sexual Morality and the Law in Foucault’s book Politics, Philosophy, Culture – Interviews and other writings, 1977-1984.</p>

                        <p>"The Danger of Child Sexuality", Foucault's dialogue with Guy Hocquenghem and Jean Danet, was produced by Roger Pillaudin and broadcast by France Culture on April 4, 1978. It was published as "La Loi de la pudeur" in RECHERCHES 37, April 1979. First published in English in Semiotext(e) Magazine (New York): Semiotext(e) Special Intervention Series 2: Loving Boys / Loving Children (Summer 1980), in a translation by Daniel Moshenberg.

                                This is the full version, published in: Michel Foucault: politics, philosophy, culture: interviews and other writings. Ed. by Lawrence D. Kritzman. (New York: Routledge, 1988). Translated by Alan Sheridan, with the title "Sexuality Morality and the Law."</p>


                                <p class="guest">
                                        <element class="speaker">MICHEL FOUCAULT:</element>All three of us agreed to take part in this broadcast (it was agreed in principle several months ago) for the following reason. Things had evolved on such a wide front, in such an overwhelming and at first sight apparently irreversible way, that many of us began to hope that the legal regime imposed on the sexual practices of our contemporaries would at last be relaxed and broken up. This regime is not as old as all that, since the penal code of 1810 (1) said very little about sexuality, as if sexuality was not the business of the law; and it was only during the 19th century and above all in the 20th, at the time of Petain or of the Mirguet amendment (1960) (2), that legislation on sexuality increasingly became oppressive. But, over the last ten years or so, a movement in public opinion and sexual morals has been discernible in favor of reconsidering this legal regime. A Commission for the Reform of Penal Law was even set up, whose task it was to revise a number of fundamental articles in the penal code. And this commission has actually admitted, I must say with great seriousness, not only the possibility, but the need to change most of the articles in our present legislation concerning sexual behavior. This commission, which has now been sitting for several months, considered this reform of the sexual legislation last May and June. I believe that the proposals it expected to make were what may be called liberal. <br><br> However, it would seem that for several months now, a movement in the opposite direction has begun to emerge. It is a disturbing movement - firstly, because it is not only occuring in France. Take, for example, what is happening in the United States, with Anita Bryant's campaign against homosexuals, which has almost gone so far as to call for murder. It's a phenomenon observable in France. But in France we see it through a number of particular, specific facts, which we shall talk about later (Jean Danet and Guy Hocquenghem will certainly provide examples), but ones that seem to show that in both police and legal practice we are returning to tougher and stricter positions. And this movement, observable in police and legal practice, is unfortunately very often supported by press campaigns, or by a system of information carried out in the press. It is therefore in this situation, that of an overall movement tending to liberalism, followed by a phenomenon of reaction, of slowing down, perhaps even the beginning of a reverse process, that we are holding our discussion this evening.</p>
                                        
                                         <p class="paul">
                                        <element class="speaker">GUY HOCQUENGHEM:</element> Six months ago we launched a petition demanding the abrogation of a number of articles in the law, in particular those concerning relations between and decriminalization of relations between adults and minors below the age of fifteen. A lot of people signed it, people belonging to a wide range of political positions, from the Communist Party to Mme. Dolto (3). So it's a petition that has been signed by a lot of people who are suspect neither of being particularly pedophiles themselves nor even of entertaining extravagant political views. We felt that a certain movement was beginning to emerge, and this movement was confirmed by the evidence submitted to the commission reforming the penal code. 
                                        <br><br>What we can now see, then, is not only that this kind of movement is something of a liberal illusion, but that in fact it does not amount to a profound transformation in the legal system, either in the way in which a case is investigated or in the way it is judged in court. 
                                        <br><br> Furthermore, at the level of public opinion, at the level of the mass media, the newspapers, radio, television, etc., it is rather the opposite that is beginning to take place, with new arguments being used. These new arguments are essentially about childhood, that is to say, about the exploitation of popular sentiment and its spontaneous horror of anything that links sex with the child. Thus in an article in the Nouvel Observeateur begins with a few remarks to the effect that "pornography involving children is the ultimate American nightmare and no doubt the most terrible in a country fertile in scandals." When someone says that child pornography is the most terrible of present scandals, one cannot but be struck by the disproportion between this - child pornography, which is not even prostitution - and everything that is happening in the world today- what the black population has to put up with in the United States, for instance. 
                                        <br><br>This whole campaign about pornography, about prostitution, about all those social phenomena - which are in any case controversial - only leads to one fundamental presupposition: 'it's worse when children are consenting and worse still if it is neither pornographic nor paid for', etc. In other words, the entire criminalizing context serves only to bring out the kernel of the accusation: you want to make love with consenting children. It serves only to stress the traditional prohibition and to stress in a new way, with new arguments, the traditional prohibition against sexual relations without violence, without money, without any form of prostitution, that may take place between adults and minors.</p>
                                        
                                         <p class="third">
                                        <element class="speaker">JEAN DANET:</element> We already know that some psychiatrists consider that sexual relations between children and adults are always traumatizing. And that if a child doesn't remember them, it is because they remain in his subconscious, but in any case the child is marked forever, the child will become emotionally disturbed. So what takes place with the intervention of psychiatrists in court is a manipulation of the children's consent, a manipulation of their words. Then there is another use - a fairly recent one, I think - of repressive legislation, which should be noted because it may be used by the legal system as a temporary tactic to fill in the gaps. Indeed in the traditional disciplinary institutions - prisons, schools, and asylums - the nurses, teachers, and so on, followed a very strict regimen. Their superiors kept as close a watch on them as on the inmates. <b></b>On the other hand, in the new agencies of social control, control through hierarchy is much more difficult. Indeed we may well wonder whether we are not witnessing a use of common-law legislation; incitement of a minor to commit an immoral act, for example, can be used against social workers and teachers. And I would point out in passing that Villerot is a teacher, that Gallien was a doctor even if the acts did not take place at a time when he was practicing his profession; that in 1976, in Nantes, a teacher was tried for inciting minors to immoral acts, when in fact what he had done was to supply contaceptives to the boys and girls in his charge. So the common-law appears to have been used this time to repress teachers and social workers who were not carrying out their task of social control as their respective hierarchies wished. Between 1830 and 1860, there already were laws directed specifically at teachers: certain judgements stated this explicitly.<b></b> Article 334 of the Penal Code - which applied to certain persons, teachers, for example, and concerned the incitement of minors to commit immoral acts - was invoked in a case that did not involve a teacher. So we can see the extent to which such legislation is ultimately looking for places where 'perverts likely to corrupt young people' might slip in. <b></b>The judges were obsessed with this. They were unable to come up with a definition of the perversions. Medicine and psychiatry were to do it for them. In the mid-19th century they had one obsession: if the pervert was everywhere, then they must start tracking him down in the most dangerous institutions, the institutions at risk, among the populations at risk, though the term had not yet been invented. If it has been possible to believe for a time that there was to be a withdrawal of legislation, it was not because we thought that we were living in a liberal period but because we knew that more subtle forms of sexual supervision would be set up - and perhaps the apparent freedom that camouflaged these more subtle, more diffuse social controls was going to extend beyond the field of the juridical and the penal. This is not always necessarily the case, and it is quite possible to believe that traditional repressive laws will function side-by-side with much more subtle form of control, a hitherto unknown form of sexology that would invade all institutions, including educational ones.</p>

                                        <element class="speaker">MICHEL FOUCAULT:</element> Indeed it seem to me that we have reached an important point. It is true that we are witnessing a real change: it is probably not true that this change will be favorable to any real alleviation of the legislation on sexuality. As Jean Danet has shown, a very large body of legislation was gradually promulgated, though not without difficulty, throughout the 19th century. But this legislation was characterized by the odd fact that it was never capable of saying exactly what it was punishing. Harassments were punished, but were never defined. Outrageous acts were punished; nobody ever said what an outrage was. The law was intended to defend decency (pudeur); nobody ever knew what pudeur was. In practice, whenever a legislative intervention into the sphere of sexuality had to be justified, the law on pudeur was always invoked. And it may be said that all the legislation on sexuality introduced since the 19th century in France is a set of laws on pudeur. It is certainly a fact that this legislative apparatus, aimed at an undefined object, was never used except in cases when it was considered to be tactically useful. Indeed, there has been a whole campaign against teachers. There was a time when it was used against the clergy. This legislation was used to regulate the phenomenon of child prostitution, so important throughout the 19th century between 1830 and 1880. We are now aware that this instrument, which possessed the advantage of flexibility, since its object was undefined, could no longer survive when these notions of pudeur, outrage, and harrassment were seen as belonging to a particular system of value, culture, and discourse; in the pornographic explosion and the profits that it involves, in this new atmosphere, it is no longer possible to use these words and to make the law function on this basis. <br><br> But what is emerging - and indeed why I believe it was important to speak about the problem of children - what is emerging is a new penal system, a new legislative system, whose function is not so much to punish offenses against these general laws concerning decency, as to protect populations and parts of populations regarded as particularly vulnerable. In other words, the legislator will not justify the measures that he is proposing by saying: the universal decency of mankind must be defended. What he will say is: there are people for whom others' sexuality may become a permanent danger. In this catagory, of course, are children, who may find themselves at the mercy of an adult sexuality that is alien to them and may well be harmful to them. Hence there is a legislation that appeals to this notion of a vulnerable population, a "high-risk population,"as they say, and to a whole body of psychiatric and psychological knowledge imbibed from psychoanalysis - it doesn't really matter whether the psychoanalysis is good or bad - and this will give the psychiatrists the right to intervene twice. <b></b>Firstly, in general terms, to say: yes, of course, children do have a sexuality, we can't go back to those old notions about children being pure and not knowing what sexuality is. But we psychologists or psychoanalysts or psychiatrists, or teachers, we know perfectly well that children's sexuality is a specific sexuality, with its own forms, its own periods of maturation, its own highpoints, its specific drives, and its own latency periods, too. This sexuality of the child is a territory with its own geography that the adult must not enter. It is virgin territory, sexual territory, of course, but territory that must preserve its virginity. The adult will therefore intervene as guarantor of that specificity of child sexuality in order to protect it. And, on the other hand, in each particular case, he will say: this is an instance of an adult bringing his own sexuality into the child's sexuality. It could be that the child, with his own sexuality, may have desired that adult, he may even have consented, he may even have made the first moves. We may even agree that it was he who seduced the adult; but we specialists with our psychological knowledge know perfectly well that even the seducing child runs a risk, in every case, of being damaged and traumatized by the fact that he or she has had sexual dealings with an adult. <b></b>Consequently, the child must be 'protected from his own desires', even when his desires turn him towards an adult. The psychiatrist is the one who will be able to say: I can predict that a trauma of this importance will occured as a result of this or that type of sexual relation. It is therefore within the new legislative framework - basically intended to protect certain vulnerable sections of the population with the establishment of a new medical power - that a conception of sexuality and above all of the relations between child and adult sexuality will be based; and it is one that is extremely questionable.</p>

                                        <element class="speaker"> GUY HOCQUENGHEM:</element> There is a whole mixture of notions that makes it possible to fabricate this notion of crime or offence against decency, a highly complex mixture, which we do not have time here to discuss at length, but which comprises both the religious prohibitions concerning sodomy and the completely new notions, to which Michel Foucault has just referred, about what people think they know of the total difference between the world of the child and the world of the adult. But todays overall tendency is indisputably not only to fabricate a type of crime that is quite simply the erotic or sensual relationship between a child and an adult, but also, since this may be isolated in the form of a crime, to create a certain category of the population defined by the fact that it tends to indulge in those pleasures. There exists then a particular category of the pervert, in the strict sense, of monsters whose aim in life is to practice sex with children. Indeed they become perverts and intolerable monsters since the crime as such is recognized and constituted, and now strengthened by the whole psychoanalytical and sociological arsenal. What we are doing is constructing an entirely new type of criminal, a criminal so inconceivably horrible that his crime goes beyond any explanation, any victim. It is rather like that kind legal monster, the term "attentat sans violence": an attack without violence that is unprovable in any case and leaves no trace, since even the anuscope is unable to find the slightest lesion that might legitimate in some way or other the notion of violence. Thus, in a way, public outrage to decency also realizes this, insofar as the offence in question does not require a public in order to be committed. In the case of "attenat sans violence", the offence in which the police have been unable to find anything, nothing at all, in that case, the criminal is simply a criminal because he is a criminal, because he has those tastes. <b></b>It is what used to be called a crime of opinion. Take the case of Parajanov. When a delegation arrived in Paris to see the representative of the Soviet embassy to hand in a protest, the Soviet representative replied: in fact you don't really know why he was condemned; he was condemned for raping a child. This representative read the press: he knew very well that this term inspired more fear that any other. The constitution of this type of criminal, the constitution of this individual perverse enough to do a thing that hitherto had always been done without anybody thinking it right to stick his nose into it, is an extremely grave step from a political point of view. Even if it has not reached the same dimensions as the campaigns against the terrorists, there are nevertheless several hundred cases going before the courts each year. And this campaign suggests that a certain section of the population must henceforth be regarded a priori as criminals, may be pursued in operations of the "help the police" type, and this is what happened in the case of Villerot. The police report noted with interest that the population took part in the search, that people used their cars to look for the pervert. <b></b>In a way the movement feeds upon itself. The crime vanishes, nobody is concerned any longer to know wether in fact a crime was committed or not, wether someone has been hurt or not. No one is even concerned any more wether there actually was a victim. The crime feeds totally upon itself in a man-hunt, by the identification, the isolation of the category of individuals regarded as pedophiles. It culminates in that sort of call for a lynching sent out nowadays by the gutter press.</p>

                                        <element class="speaker">JEAN DANET:</element> It is true that lawyers defending these cases have a lot of problems. But I should like to say something specifically about such problems. In cases like the Croissant affair, the terrorists' lawyers were regarded immediately as dangerous accomplices of the terrorists (4). Anyone who came into contact with the affair became implicated. Similarly, the defense of someone found guilty of an indecent act with a minor, especially in the provinces, has extremely serious problems, because many lawyers simply cannot take on such a defense, avoid doing so, and prefer being appointed by the court. For, in a way, anyone who defends a pedophile may be suspected of having some sympathy for that cause. Even judges think to themselves: if he defends them, it's because he isn't really as much against it himself. It's a serious matter, though it's almost laughable really, it's a fact known to anyone who has had to deal with such cases wether in the provinces or in Paris: it is extremely difficult both for the lawyer to defend such a case and even sometimes to find a lawyer willing to do so. A lawyer will be quite happy to defend someone accused of ten old ladies. That doesn't bother him in the least. But to defend someone who has touched some kid's cock for a second, that's a real problem. That is part of the whole set up around this new sort of criminal, the adult who has erotic relations with children.

                                        I apologize for referring to history once again, but I think in this matter one can usefully refer to what happened in the 19th and early 20th centuries. When an open letter to the commision for the reform of the penal code was published and signatures placed at the bottom of this letter, it was remarked that a number of psychologists, sexologists, and psychiatrists had signed. What they were demanding, then, was the decriminalization of immoral acts with minors over the age of fifteen, a different regime for immoral acts with minors between fifteen and eighteen, abolition of the offense of public outrage etc., etc. The fact that psychiatrists and psychologists demanded that the law be brought up to date on this point did not mean that they were on the side of those who were subjected to such repression. <b></b>What I mean is, just because one is involved in a struggle against some authority, in this instance, the legal authorities, this does not mean one is on the side of those who are subjected to it. This is proved by the example of Germany, where from the 19th century onwards, from 1870, a whole movement protested against a law that was aimed at homosexuals, paragraph 175 of the German penal code. It was not even a habitual crime. There was no need to be an acknowledged homosexual; a single homosexual act was enough, whatever it may be. So a whole movement developed, made up of homosexuals, but also of doctors and psychiatrists, to demand the abolition of this law. But if one reads the literature published by these doctors and psychiatrists it becomes absolutely clear that they expected only one thing from the abolition of this law, namely, to be able to take over the perverts for themselves and to treat them with all the knowledge that they claimed to have aquired since around 1860. <b></b>With Morel's "Treatise On Degeneracy" what we have is the setting up of a whole nosography of the perversions; and these psychiatrists were demanding in fact that the perverts be handed over to them, that the law should give up any dealings it may have with sexuality, which it speaks of so badly, in so unscientific a way, and that they should be able to treat cases in a perhaps less aggressive, less systematic, less blind way than the law; they alone could say in each case who was guilty, who was sick, and calmly decide what measures were to be taken (5). I'm not saying that thing were reproduced in the same way, but it is interesting to see how the two authorities could be in competition to get hold of that 'population of perverts'.</p>

                                        <element class="speaker"> MICHEL FOUCAULT: </element> I'm certainly not going to sum up everything that has been said. I think Hocquenghem has shown very clearly what was developing in relation to the strata of the population that had to be "protected." On the other hand, there is childhood, which by its very nature is in danger and must be protected against every possible danger, and therefore any possible act or attack. Then, on the other hand, there are dangerous individuals, who are generally adults of course, so that sexuality, in the new system that is being set up, will take on quite a different appearance from the one it used to have. In the past, laws prohibited a number of acts, indeed acts so numerous one was never quite sure what they were, but, nevertheless, it was acts that the law concerned itself with. Certain forms of behavior were condemned. Now what we are defining and, therefore, what will be found by the intervention of the law, the judge, and the doctor, are dangerous individuals. We're going to have a society of dangers, with, on the one side, those who are in danger, and on the other, those who are dangerous. And sexuality will no longer be a kind of behavior hedged in by precise prohibitions, but a kind of roaming danger, a sort of omnipresent phantom, a phantom that will be played out between men and women, children and adults, and possibly between adults themselves, etc. Sexuality will become a threat in all social relations, in all relations between members of different age groups, in all relations between individuals. It is on this shadow, this phantom, this fear that the authorities would try to get a grip through an apparently generous and, at least general, legislation and through a series of particular interventions that would probably be made by the legal institutions, with the support of the medical institutions. And what we will have there is a new regime for the supervision of sexuality; in the second half of the 20th century it may well be decriminalized, but only to appear in the form of a danger, a universal danger, and this represents a considerable change. I would say that the danger lay there.</p>
                                        
                                        <p> DISCUSSION
                                                <p>PIERRE HAHN: I simply would like to mention a work that appeared about ten years ago, but which seems to me to be rather important in the present context. It is a work on the personality of exhibitionists. On the one hand, then, there is this classification that leads to excluding a certain type of exhibitionist from what I would call the system of psychoanalytic reeducation and, on the other hand, it actually consists in returning, but in rather different ways, apparently to the notion of the born criminal. I just would like to quote this sentence from the book, because it seems to me significant and then I shall say why: "The exhibitionist perversion is a category of exhibitionistic perverts - exhibitionistic perversion corresponds here to a phenomenon of radical amputation from part of the instincts, and this amputation takes place at a stage that is neither genital nor non-genital in sexual development, but in that still mysterious area where personality and instinct seem to me to be potential." Yes, we are back to Lombroso's notion of the born criminal, which the author himself had just quoted (6). It really is something present before birth, something that appears to be in the embryo; and if I mention the embryo it is because at the present time we are seeing a strong return of old methods, though perhaps wrapped up in new forms: methods such as psycho-surgery, in which, for example, homosexuals, pedophiles, and rapists might be operated on in the brain. On the other hand, certain genetic manipulations are being carried out: we had proof of this quite recently, especially in East Germany. All this seems to me very disturbing. Of course, it is pure repression. But, on the other hand, it is also evidence of a certain use of the critique of psychoanalysis that is in a sense quite reactionary, I would say, in inverted commas.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The expert referred to in the text I have quoted is called Jacqes Stephani, a psychiatrist in Bordeaux who has contributed to the study of the exhibitionist personality. The expert actually says that the judge must act as one element in a process of therapeutic reeducation, except in the extreme case where the subject is regarded as beyond rehabilitation. This is the moral madman, Lombroso's born criminal. Indeed this idea that legislation, the legal system, the penal system, even medicine must concern themselves essentially with dangers, with dangerous individuals rather than acts, dates more or less from Lombroso and so it is not at all surprising if one finds Lombroso's ideas comming back into fashion. Society has to defend itself against dangerous individuals. There are dangerous individuals by nature, by heredity, by genetic code, etc.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Q: I would just like to ask Guy Hocquenghem, who gave us an outline of some examples of the repression associated today with this type of act, how can we create strategic alliances to fight in that area? The natural allies of this type of movement - which are, lets say, the progressive groups- are somewhat reticent about getting mixed up in this sort of business. Movements such as the women's movement are focusing their activities on such problems as rape and are succeeding in increasing the penalization of such acts.</p>
                                        
                                         <p class="paul">
                                        <element class="speaker"> GUY HOCQUENGHEM:</element> We were very careful in the text of the Open Letter to the Penal Code. We took great care to speak exclusively of an indecent act not involving violence and incitement of a minor to commit an indecent act. We were extremely careful not to touch, in any way, on the problem of rape, which is totally different. Now I agree with you on one thing, and that is that we have all seen the television program on rape and were all shocked by the reactions it aroused in France, some of which even went so far as telephone calls requesting the chemical castration of the rapists. There are two problems here. There is the problem of rape in the strict sense, on which the women's movement and women in general have expressed themselves perfectly clearly, but there is the other problem of the reactions at the level of public opinion. One triggers off secondary effects of man-hunting, lynching, or moral mobilization.</p>

                                        <element class="speaker">JEAN DANET:</element>: I should like to add something in reply to the same question. When we say that the problem of consent is quite central in matters concerned with pedophilia, we are not, of course, saying that consent is always there. But - and this is where one may separate the attitude of the law with regard to rape and with regard to pedophilia - in the case of rape, judges consider that there is a presumption of consent on the part of the woman and that the opposite has to be demonstrated. Whereas where pedophilia is concerned, it's the opposite. It's considered that there is a presumption of non-consent, a presumption of violence, even in a case where no charge of an indecent act with violence has been made, that is, in a case in which the charge used is that of indecent act without violence, that is, with consenting pleasure - because it has to be said that this act without violence is the repressive, legal translation of consenting pleasure. It's pretty clear haw the system of proof is manipulated in opposite ways in the case of rape of women and in the case of indecent assault on a minor. Q: Public opinion, including enlightened opinion such as that of the doctors of the Institute of Sexology, asked at what age there can be said to be definite consent. It's a big problem.</p>

                                        <element class="speaker"> MICHEL FOUCAULT: </element> Yes, it is difficult to lay down barriers. Consent is one thing; it is a quite different thing when we are dealing with the likelihood of a child being believed when, speaking of his sexual relations, his affections, his tender feelings, or his contacts (the sexual adjective is often an embarrassment here, because it does not correspond to reality), a child's ability to explain what his feelings are, what actually happened, how far he is believed, these are quite different things. now, where children are concerned, they are supposed to have a sexuality that can never be directed towards an adult, and that's that. Secondly, it is supposed that they are not capable of talking about themselves, of being sufficiently lucid about themselves. They are unable to express their feelings about the whole thing. Therefore they are not believed. They are thought to be incapable of sexuality and they are not thought to be capable of speaking about it. But, after all, listening to a child, hearing him speak, hearing him explain what his relations actually were with someone, adult or not, provided one listens with enough sympathy, must allow one to establish more or less what degree of violence if any was used or what degree of consent was given. And to assume that a child is incapable of explaining what happened and was incapable of giving his consent are two abuses that are intolerable, quite unacceptable.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Q: If you were a legislator, you would fix no limit and you would leave it to the judges to decide wether or not an indecent act was committed with or without consent? Is that your position?</p>

Again, the child may be trusted to say wether or not he was subjected to violence. An examining magistrate, a liberal, told me once when we were discussing this question: after all, there are eighteen-year-old girls who are practically forced to make love with their fathers or their stepfathers; they may be eighteen, but it's an intolerable system of constraint. And one, moreover, that they feel is intolerable, if only people are willing to listen to them and put them in conditions which they can say what they feel.</p>

In any case, we don't regard ourselves as legislators, but simply as a movement of opinion that demands the abolition of certain pieces of legislation. Our role isn't to make up new ones. As far as this question of consent is concerned, I prefer the terms used by Michel Foucault: listen to what the child says and give it a certain credence. This notion of consent is a trap, in any case. What is sure is that the legal form of an intersexual consent is nonsense. No one signs a contract before making love.</p>

                                        <element class="speaker"> GUY HOCQUENGHEM:</element> It's a purely contractual notion. When we say that children are "consenting" in these cases, all we intend to say is this:in any case, there was no violence, or organized manipulation in order to wrench out of them affective or erotic relations. It's an important point, all the more important for the children because it's an ambiguous victory in that to get a judge to organize a ceremony in which the children come and say that they were actually consenting is an ambiguous victory. The public affirmation of consent to such acts is extremely difficult, as we know. Everybody - judges, doctors, the defendant - knows that the child was consenting - but nobody says anything, because, apart from anything else, there's no way it can be introduced. It's not simply the effect of a prohibition by law: it's really impossible to express a very complete relationship between a child and an adult - a relation that is progressive, long, goes through all kinds of stages, which are not all exclusively sexual, through all kinds of affective contacts. To express this in terms of legal consent is an absurdity. In any case, if one listens to what a child says and if he says" I didn't mind," that doesn't have the legal value of "I consent." But I'm also very mistrustful of that formal recognition of consent on the part of a minor, because I know it will never be obtained and is meaningless in any case.</p>

                        <h3> Why do some people enjoy physical pain or become aroused by it? For Kal, the discovery came
                                with a lot of complications; he was a young boy and it was at the hands of a powerful
                                and sadistic pedophile Rabbi (Heshy Brier) who is now a fugitive living in Israel. Kal
                                shares about his years of self-destruction and bottoming out before eventually getting
                                sober and starting the process of healing and advocating for other survivors. </h3>

                                <element class="speaker">K:</element>So I was a kid, I can't remember at what age, when
                                I was recommended to go see a doctor for medication for depression and for acting out
                                and for, think of like a soul who just grew up wanting to explore the world, wanting to
                                be free, wanting to be able to ask questions, be able to explore, be able to just be me,
                                and all through my childhood I was being stifled more and more. <br><br>
                                So I almost feel, when I look back at my life, I kind of feel God had a sense of humor
                                and just by mistake threw me into the wrong group of people. I didn't belong
                                there.<br><br>So, as I was growing up, I have tons of siblings. I am, I didn't
                                particularly feel very close to my parents. I used to joke, and I know it sounds a bit
                                harsh, but the only time I knew my father really intimately was when he was beating me
                                and I was laying in my own blood. Now, that wasn't regularly and he's not a rageful
                                person and he was just a very, very pious, very disciplined person, but just the way he
                                dealt with disciplining me was not a very particular effective way and was mostly
                                beating us.

                                of his personal anger out?

                                <element class="speaker">K:</element> --he once found me in a room, rather like, hey,
                                what's going on with you, are you feeling left out, like is there any way that you want
                                to be seen that you're not being seen or you're not being appreciated, whatever healthy
                                communication would come in, it wasn't that. It was more like, you should not have done
                                it and now you're going to be beaten for it.<br> But sexual abuse started coming into my
                                life around age eight and nine by the right-hand person of the Square rebbe. So think of
                                where he lives and, right next to the temple, and they drive cars with sirens and
                                lights, and it's almost like a police force of security. Whenever he would drive
                                somewhere, they were always like flying with lights and sirens. And there were many
                                times when Square rebbe would fly somewhere, literally where highways would be blocked
                                off in order for him to be able, like you see these people like as above the law.

                                presidents. He meets with governors. Like it's not, so his right-hand person is somebody
                                who is really, really powerful. Growing up in that community, those are people that you
                                look up to.

                                people looked the other way because they didn't want to draw attention to it because it
                                might put the program at risk.

                                <element class="speaker">K:</element> So that was exactly that. I mean, I remember as a
                                kid walking into his office, and he would open the safe and I remember seeing stacks of
                                cash. I mean, think about it. The Square rebbe sits in his office, sits in his, in this
                                holy, beautiful, regal room, when he sees people from all over the world that come to
                                get his blessing. A part of doing that is they give him what they call a kritl[sp?], or
                                they'll give him a little paper with the names of your kids, and it's always attached to
                                a $100 bill or a $50 bill or $1,000 or like, every single human being that goes in to
                                see the Square rebbe goes in to see them with a note and cash.<br><br>So that's just how
                                they do it. That's just the way of giving back. It's a way of supporting the leadership.
                                It's a part of you give something of you and now, then he blesses you with like, it's
                                kind of like when you look at the rebbe, there's rebbe and then there's like a clear
                                path to the creator of the universe and all the requests and desires and aspirations and
                                people being sick or life decisions, you go, he looks at this piece of sheet and he kind
                                of like goes into this trance, and then he starts praying with you and he gives you
                                directions and gives different blessings, and it's always with cash. So--
                        </p>

                                <element class="speaker">P:</element> And can you hear the cash register over the

                                in my pocket.

                                access to me. Now, I saw lots of kids my age and a bit older that were always going in
                                and out of his office, and you could never tell why, although there's cameras everywhere
                                and everything is being recorded, but there could be a million different reasons why I
                                would be there.<br><br>
                                My grandmother might have sent me to go pick something up, or my mother who's involved
                                in helping the community in another particular way he's asking a question or, I mean,
                                there's, everything is so intertwined. So, me not feeling always very comfortable at
                                home, me feeling always pressured in the community for many reasons, me being out late
                                before different holidays or before, like when the Square rebbe, one of his kids or
                                grandkids will get married, it's like the Super Bowl. I mean, there's lights and they're
                                building bleachers and signs, and it's, like there's always something going on in that
                                community that was this big-deal celebration.<br><br>
                                But he had, now years later I know, he had years and years and years of history of
                                abusing kids. Now, when I got sober at 18 and I started going through my own process of
                                recovery and confronting a lot of, all of the crap that I went through as a kid and
                                having left that community and, I mean, leading up, before 18, it was just rage and
                                anger and, I mean, it was a community that just got away with anything.

                                there are so many factors at play. So even being my age, being who he was, he had no
                                right to ever take me outside of the community. You know, like he knows the
                                rules.<br><br>

                                Like, yes, maybe I was helping build something or maybe I was helping with organizing
                                something, which I was many times all through like nine, 10, 11, 12, but, so I remember
                                when I was fairly young, and I don't remember the exact age, we would drive outside of
                                the community. He would take me into this building called the Refuah Health Center,
                                which is kind of like, it's not a hospital but it's a medical center, which serves for a
                                lot of people outside of the community but also most of our community uses that.<br><br>

                                And I remember distinctly one particular time where it wasn't even, we never, maybe we
                                did. I haven't thought of like the actual sensation in the communications of, what words
                                were exchanged that had the understanding that I was going to get in the car, supposedly
                                by my choice, and then drive outside of the community.<br><br>

                                And it was, obviously it was so significant. Like I'm sitting in this like, this car
                                that has all the lights and sirens and all the gadgets, and it's this really important--

                                summers. We would have, we would go to Muncie. Like me and my family, we have been
                                outside of the community. Not, as a kid, I wouldn't go by myself, but I have been out of
                                the community with my family. But there's a lot of kids at that age that have never
                                left. They don't even go away for camp. Like, that's the community and the world they
                                live in.<br><br>

                                But I, the moment, the most significant moment of this particular story is walking into
                                that building and remembering, like he would, he undid the alarm of the building, and
                                this building is like, what, I don't know, a five-story building or four-story building,
                                massive, in my head, being this little kid, and then the door locking behind me and that
                                chill, like the entire hallway walking into the building is dark.

                                again, which means we would have to go up to the next floor before the alarm would turn

                                there's, I've gotten to know a very interesting victimization trance, and I'll tell you

                                know, even, and then going upstairs and then bending over one of the doctor's tables and
                                then him taking off his belt and me negotiating with him, if he was going to beat me

                                I remember around that time in my life, again, most people that are in arranged
                                marriages, their siblings are getting married. Most kids in that community, people are
                                marrying people in that community.

                                whenever you do that, just like a note to self, whenever someone is marrying outside of

                                So my oldest brother had his own issues and his own problems, I won't go into detail,
                                but he was marrying
                                somebody from outside of the community, so our entire family was in Borough Park for the
                                weekend, the weekend
                                after he got married.<br><br>

                                So I'll give you another visual. There's this huge building, obviously I went back years
                                later and it's not
                                that, it's not as big, but as a kid, it's around, sometimes in the afternoon, really hot
                                outside in the summer,
                                Brooklyn, New York, and we had spent the whole afternoon at the family's home and, which
                                was really lovely. We
                                came for, you know, Jews, they do that three different prayers in a day, and so it was
                                close to Minchah, and we
                                are in this synagogue and if the door was over there, I was standing next to two adults
                                and they were talking to
                                each other and all of a sudden--
                        </p>




                        <p class="paul">
                                <element class="speaker">P:</element> Kal was pointing to his right--
                        </p>

                        <p class="guest">
                                <element class="speaker">K:</element> Like the far right, and I'm literally looking
                                northwest, and if you're looking, southeast is where the door was.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paul">
                                <element class="speaker">P:</element> Mm-hmm.

                        <p class="guest">
                                <element class="speaker">K:</element> And, you know, we had just arrived there, nothing
                                in particular was going on in the building, and all of a sudden my entire body flipped
                                around, like literally someone was pulling my hair chest to four doors right next to
                                each other, and towards the end the door was open probably a foot and a half, and a guy
                                standing there with a lollipop and showing me to come.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paul">
                                <element class="speaker">P:</element> What [incredulously]?
                        </p>

                        <p class="guest">
                                <element class="speaker">K:</element> There's no better way of descriptions. It's
                                exactly how it happened. I'm doing my thing, standing there next to a few adults, and
                                all of a sudden my whole body turns and I see this guy with a lollipop and all of a
                                sudden I felt, I literally felt like he was pulling me through thin air to follow
                                him.<br><br>

                                I go through that door. I walk down three staircases. And he pushes me into the corner
                                and starts pulling down my pants and, all of a sudden, I came to, pushed him away, ran
                                upstairs, I'm out of breath and I'm almost like skipping over the stairs, run back to
                                where I was standing before, and the few adults, they look down at me and they go, it
                                was almost like they had, I had no idea how long that took. It could have been a second.
                                It could have been two minutes. It could have been a half an hour. Time didn't
                                exist.<br><br>

                                And one of the reasons why I, when I tell that story, it's kind of like I had this
                                invisible sign on my forehead that said fuck me, and that's the relationship between
                                pedophiles and victims that I was always fascinated by. There is something in the
                                victimization that victims take comfort in, and almost in the re-victimization of
                                abuse.<br><br>

                                Now, I don't understand and I have not studied that extensively. I did run a non-profit
                                for the prevention of childhood sexual abuse. I did meet with a lot of offenders and
                                victims.

                                between that. And I believe it's something that abusers, all abusers, be it physical

                                or I should say many, many people that I have met who have been victimized, there is a
                                desire to please that they see, I don't know, I suppose an innocence. And is it
                                conscious in the person that does it?

                                verbal communication, body language might be a part of it, but there is, I think there's
                                an energetic, invisible dynamic that plays out.

                                from across the room the guy who is will then abuse her for the next five years, their

                                the abuser for doing what he did.

                                There is an identity that gets built around victimization, and that's certainly as you
                                grow up. You know, when I started going through my own recovery and I started looking at
                                my own actions, there is--

                                <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right. Belief systems, like what was making up
                                this dysfunctional life of mine, and we can talk about in a moment how that came about,
                                but there is, there's a benefit that I, there's a benefit and a comfort for being locked
                                in, in a victim identity, as in, one, I know how it feels, two, I know how to maneuver
                                around it. Like we, as human beings, I believe that we build entire self-image based on
                                victimization.

                                <element class="speaker">P:</element> Because at the time we believe it to be true, we

                                that a lot. I mean, why do people that are being physically abused stay with their
                                abuser? I mean, it's rather to stay, rather than going through so much discomfort and
                                even terror that is predicted than the unknown that is not predicted.

                                a little kid and the kid is really confused and the kid is like, feels taken advantage
                                of, like obviously I'll
                                look at him and be like, you're a kid. Like, regardless of what was going through your
                                brain or your mind, it's
                                not relevant. He's an adult. You're a kid. You should know love, security,
                                predictability, healthy environments.
                                Any adult that breaks that should be thrown off a building, for lack of a better

                                Like, if I'm looking at it as black and white, I go, no, you as a kid, you are, you come
                                into the world, what
                                you should know is safety. What you should know is security. So when you go into the
                                big, crazy adult world, you
                                can start adapting to the lack of security and predictability in a healthy way.

                                frequently differed, and
                                when I go back into my experiences and I talk to other victims, you know, most victims,
                                or a lot, a lot of
                                victims, definition of their victim means that they have been violated. There's
                                something that happened to them
                                that they, in their right mind, would not want to have happen to them. They were touched
                                in a particular way,
                                hurt in a particular way. It confuses them, and the scars stay inside them. And I always
                                felt that the trauma,
                                for lack of a better word, that I went through was educational in one way, introduced me
                                to different domains of
                                my own personal life and my own personal experience that I would not have gotten if I
                                was just a normal child,
                                treated normally.<br><br>

                                So I only started using abuse when I started encountering other victims from this
                                community and from victims
                                that I know who were victimized by him, that his interactions with them were a lot more
                                crazy and more abusive.
                                And so I, so yeah, it's an interesting topic.

                                <element class="speaker">K:</element> I would venture to say, as an adult who is being
                                beaten with a stick or with a cane or with a whip and can hardly sit had the same
                                sensations and the same experiences that I did when I was eight, nine years old. Well,
                                granted, well, if it was my child, I would want to rip that person apart, but given that
                                it was me, and now looking to my experience from my adulthood, I don't see it as
                                abuse.<br><br>

                                So I've always seen myself as privileged in the sense that this thing that we call
                                resilience, that most psychologists and psychiatrists could never give me a correct
                                answer on what that actually is, but I would assume that it's very similar of a word
                                than like what is a spiritual experience. Well, we can give you some parameters and it
                                translates to different people differently, but I feel once I started dealing with my
                                own, with forgiveness around the anger, and the anger was not so much that experience.
                                The anger was so much, was more about being abandoned, not being understood, and
                                naturally so.

                                I started telling other people about what had happened, when I started talking to other

                                community but, in the same time, you're representing care and compassion to what I went
                                through. And I remember my brain kind of short circuiting.<br><br>

                                So for me to say that I've always believed that my experience growing up was a positive
                                would be a lie, because all through my teens I was, I used to envision taking a gun and
                                shooting that guy. I used to, I was rageful against that culture, so I can't say I was
                                like, it helped me come to be this healthy, good human being [chuckles]. But it's very
                                interesting even now, sitting right here, like thinking about how disturbing that
                                experience was up to 18 and now there's not a conscious cell in my body that sees that
                                experience as negative.
