      <h1> Interview with Sophie </h1>
      <h2> The 27 year-old listener discusses hearing voices, dealing with Borderline Personality disorder and/or Bipolar II, hypomania as well as the abusive “relationship” she had with a 22 year-old when she was 12 and how she began self-harming then. </h2>
      <h3> 02/28/2014</h3>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker"><p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element></element>One of the things that I like to talk about, if you're comfortable talking about it, is the manner in which these predators get their way. What they say, how they act, how they groom people. I want to understand more of how they get away with it. I guess in the hopes that someday maybe there can be a telltale warning signs that we can share with children, beware if this starts happening. If this happens, this is not okay, even though it may be exciting to you. Are you comfortable talking about the details?</p>
      <p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">Sophie:</element>Yea, so it started off in this theater arts troupe and when you do like a theater production, everyone gets really close really fast. You're working together like everyday.</p>
       <p class="paul">
          <element class="speaker">P:</element>And it's exciting and the bonding is like you being yourself and you're letting your freak flag fly, you're being expressive, you're not being judged.</p>
      <p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">S:</element> Yea, so after, I mean we all felt really close to each other, but it wasn't a real closeness, because it's not something you build up overtime it's kind of superficial, but I was feeling comfortable with everyone and I sort of admired him anyway and we exchanged screen names, this is back in the day when you do the AOL instant messenger and so we started talking online and I felt safe with him and he treated me like an equal. Like he didn't treat me like a child and I think that's something that people, children need to look out for and it's hard to recognize because you want to be treated equally when you're young especially when you're around that age, 12 or 13, you want to be treated as an adult.
      </p>
    <p class="paul">
      <element class="speaker"><p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element></element>And to me a red flag right away is somebody having an online relationship with that age difference.</p>
    <p class="guest">
      <element class="speaker">S:</element>Yea and it progressed where we started hanging out one on one and then I would sneak out of my house and he would come pick me up and take me back to his apartment. At the time, I thought it was a real relationship, I know now it wasn't. And even for years after that I always saw it as a great thing, a great experience.</p>
      <p class="paul">
        <element class="speaker">P:</element>You want to be older, it's like 'I'm 12 and a half!'</p>
        <p class="guest">
          <element class="speaker">S:</element>Yea it wasn't until my early twenties that I came to terms with the fact that it was sexual abuse, it was child abuse and it was something that was very harmful to me.</p>
      <p class="paul">
          <element class="speaker">P:</element>Was it when you became his age that you could see it?</p>
      <p class="guest">
          <element class="speaker">S:</element>Yea, I think so, cause I started to realized, woah imagine me, you know, getting into some situation with a 12 year old boy, like that just seems terrible.</p>
      <p class="paul"> <element class="speaker">P:</element>What did you feel or think when that moment hit you?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Um, I felt really like, I felt like I was taken advantage of, like obviously I was physically taken advantage of, but I felt like everything I had thought about who I was, like I was an adult and I was sophisticated, it was all a lie. And it really sort of cut me down to size.</p>
      <p class="paul"> <element class="speaker">P:</element>I think that's what hurts the most about sexual abuse, is the being tricked.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Yea and it's hard now, because if I met him today, if I saw him today, I don't know if I'd punch him in the face or hug him. You know, there's still that part of me that remembers thinking that I was totally in love with him, so that's really hard to deal with, knowing it was abuse and still having that tenderness for him. You know it's really shocking and upsetting to me.</p>
      <p class="paul"> <element class="speaker">P:</element>Thank you for sharing that part of it, because I think that's one of the most difficult things in confronting the abuse that happened to you, to us, is that its so complicated because there are often positive feelings towards the abuser and you feel like you're throwing them under the bus to call them a predator or whatever. Because we do often see that humanity, but then we also think to ourselves, was it all an act? But my thought is that, I don't think there can be genuine tenderness between somebody who is in the state of abusing somebody, to me it all falls under the heading of grooming and mind control. I think.. I don't know that's just my personal opinion, but getting back to the time that you spent with him, like what would he say to you to introduce the physical aspect?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Well, I think and this is something that's really difficult for me to swallow, is that I think I instigated it. If he was so smart grooming me that you know I thought I was in charge of the situation and then we started talking online and I don't remember if I brought it up or if he brought it up, like 'oh, come pick me up.'</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>Trust me, trust me. He was grooming you, this was him, from the moment that he began an email relationship with you that was beyond maybe just 'hey I'm having trouble with this part, can I email you?' 'yea sure' you know, like I get emails sometimes from girls who are 15 years old and they're like 'I'm cutting, I don't know what to do' Well clearly, I'm going to email them back and say go see a therapist or whatever, but I think there's a qualification to a relationship with somebody who is age inappropriate on the internet and to me it just sounds like this guy, right out of the gate, he knew what he wanted. Who was the one who suggested that you started corresponding via email?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>I don't remember.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>Okay, anyway, you remember that you initiated that you wanted to take it further, and I hope you don't blame yourself for that, because it's up to the adult to know what is appropriate.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Yea, I mean, it's just hard to swallow, it's hard to wrap my head around and it's hard for me to understand because I have great male role models, I was never abused by anyone else like physically or emotionally, so it just came out of no where and that's something thats really hard to deal with. Like, where did this come from, how is it so easy for me to be preyed upon?</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>I'm glad you shared that, because I know there are so many listeners that are feeling and thinking that same thing, so then they want to go to the place 'well I must be inherently bad' or perverted, or I hate the word “slutty” or they wanted that and it breaks my heart to think that somebody is putting any of the blame on themselves. Where are you today with that thing, have you let go of the shame and the blame?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Um, intellectually I have, like I understand now that I was so young and I was being manipulated and that, you know, I don't understand why I did it, but it happened. But emotionally, I still hang on to that and I still feel shame and thats hard to get over.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>But the fact that you say, why I did it.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>What do you mean?</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker>">P:</element>You're inferring that it was your decision.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Oh, right. Like that I had the power?</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker>">P:</element>Yea and thats the part of the sick genius of the predator, is they make you think that you have a choice in this. They sense what you long for as a child and they pervert that need for it, to lure you into what it is that they want from you and they give you the illusion that you wanted it. When what you probably wanted was so much more pure than that. I would imagine, you just wanted the attention from this guy?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>I thought that I was totally in love, like I thought it was true love. Like this was the wonderful magical thing.</p>

      <h1> Interview with Jess </h1>
      <h2> Paul’s friend opens about her chaotic childhood in New Orleans, her abandonment issues, and the struggling to find words to categorize the sex she wanted and got at 12, from a 27 year-old man. She also talk about the self-doubt of giving up her fledgling comedy career to become a therapist. </h2>
      <h3> 02/01/2013</h3>

      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker"><p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element></element>So then you go live with your mom and did you sister come with you?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">Jess:</element>My sister went first. She turned ten first. She’s a couple of years older than me, so she went to go live with my mother and stepfather and then I moved out there when I was ten. My father actually threatened my stepmother’s child once cuz she was being mad that she was gonna be sent to go live with my mother and stepfather, which I thought was funny because she doesn’t know them. So I went to—I moved to San Francisco and you know I was a miserable child. I was throwing up every night still and I had no friends, I had no ability to make friends, I had never had a friend in my life. I didn’t have a friend until I was a sophomore in high school, I just didn’t allow people near me. And then I joined up—my brother and sister were already going to this karate school and it was the first time I had experienced value because I would go to this karate school and people thought, you know, it was cute, there was this little kid, I was eleven years old, ten or eleven, and I was doing karate and I was really thriving in it and I was like getting up there in the belts and going to tournaments. At the karate school there were just—the karate studio was made up—the majority were men, older men, like 20’s and 30’s.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>I don't like where this is going.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element>You’re not going to. So 20’s, 30’s. There was woman there that was the wife of the main guy and I just idealized her. She was so cool to me. I found out later on that she was actually the victim of domestic violence from the main guy. So I started hanging out every day, you know. It was the only sense of—I felt like a family with these people, they cared about me. All the while kind of realizing there was an element a little off there, you know. A lot of these older men were very—clients would come in, like customers, karate people would come in and they would be very flirtatious, very sexual, saying sexual things in the office after these women would leave. And there were things called private lessons, you know, where like you would go in the back and do a karate lesson. And so I’m working there, you know, I’m there like six days a week. I’m cleaning the floors, cleaning the windows, you know, I’d become like the mascot. Then I get to a certain level and I start teaching private lessons. Which would be to the adults, I would teach them—I’m eleven at this point and I’m teaching them the basics of karate, you know, all the while I’m discovering, because I’m 11 or 12, I’m discovering my sexuality. You know, I’m discovering I can get attention if I maybe wear a small shirt under my karate uniform. Or, you know, it was the only form of attention that I’d ever really received, so I just went for it. You know, and I played up the idea of being the Lolita and the truth is that if you challenge enough men, odds are that one will bite, you know.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>And I think probably those men don’t realize that the 12-year-old you had a really innocent idea of what sex and flirtation is. That she doesn’t know what she’s getting into, she doesn’t know what kind of a trap she’s setting. She doesn’t know what she’s going to catch. She thinks she’s going to get attention and maybe a little bit—I mean you weren’t hoping to become sexual with these people, were you? You just wanted …</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element>Well, I think this is where it gets really, really shady. And this is where a lot of people that might be listening might get upset, because I still hold to the belief that when I was that young I absolutely wanted to be sexual and I absolutely knew what I was doing because I was—I just learned so early how to manipulate the situation because I needed to to survive. I needed to know how to read people and I needed to know how to work people. And if that meant I was going to get attention and survive, because I was being seen, you know, it didn’t matter how I was being seen. If I was being seen, I was gonna survive. So if it meant I was gonna be sexual or be you know, overtly sexual to these older men, fine.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element> But my point too Jess is that the 12-year-old’s version of what being sexual is going to encompass is going to be different than what an adult who has already lived and experienced that knows. So that child still, even though they may want that thing, is still that adult should know that and see that and not engage that because they know that child doesn’t know what they’re getting into to.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element>Absolutely. That’s, I mean, that I agree with. You know, years into my recovery I had a friend of mine say to me once, “All right, Jess. I want you to go on the Internet right now and I want you to find one 12-year-old boy, one, that you find attractive, one.” You know, and as soon as she said that I realized I was looking through it through an older person’s eyes. It’s insane, you know. And you know I just—like I said, you play the odds enough, you know, and the person that I ended up having these intimate relations with, he was a 27-year-old ex-Marine and God only knows what he had been through and what he had seen and what he had done already, you know, overseas, he went to the first Gulf War and so he came in as a student. I was teaching him, and, you know, over the next year and a half, we started spending time together and the part that always got me was that my mother and stepfather had no problem with me spending time, as much as I did then.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>That’s the part that makes my fucking jaw drop. Talk about—you told the story about him coming to pick you up for a fucking date and your mom and stepdad signing off on that.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element>Well my stepdad was already back in New Orleans and my mother, my mother at that time was then into, I’m pretty sure she was into pill addiction at that time. And also when I asked her about it, she said, “If I had any idea, you know, all I knew is that you were happy. That’s the only time you were happy,” you know. And for that, I just need to let that go, you know, it was—I don’t know it’s really—I swear it felt like what I thought dating would be. You know, I would go and I would spend hours there with him.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>That’s the part that makes my fucking jaw drop. Talk about—you told the story about him coming to pick you up for a fucking date and your mom and stepdad signing off on that.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element>Well my stepdad was already back in New Orleans and my mother, my mother at that time was then into, I’m pretty sure she was into pill addiction at that time. And also when I asked her about it, she said, “If I had any idea, you know, all I knew is that you were happy. That’s the only time you were happy,” you know. And for that, I just need to let that go, you know, it was—I don’t know it’s really—I swear it felt like what I thought dating would be. You know, I would go and I would spend hours there with him.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>I’m sure the attention was electric. Because not only was it attention from a guy, it was attention from a 27-year-old guy, which is got explode a 12-year-old’s ego.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element>It was pretty wild you know. We never had actual sex, we had, well, you know, full on sex. We had different forms, and yeah, you know, it was, in a 12-year-old’s mind we were dating.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>What was—what were the sexual experiences like for you in terms of what you what you thought they were going to be? Were they fulfilling? Were they confusing? Were they good and bad? Was it all bad?</p>

      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element>It was pretty spot on of what I thought it would be. To be honest, it was fulfilling. I never did anything to him. It was all him. It was—I’m amazed no one at the studio knew. Everyone claims they didn’t know. You know, but there was someone living with him at the time, another teacher at the studio, and how he didn’t know is beyond me. You know, because I would be spending the whole day on the weekends there, you know.</p>

      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>That boggles my mind.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element> There was a lot of—it was really super shady. But you know, fast forward, you know, we have this final date, the one you’re speaking of where he picks me up and gives my mom a bottle of wine or champagne or something and me a rose and we go on a date, and then I move back to New Orleans. And then</p>

      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element> <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>And when you moved back to New Orleans, were you sorry to not see him anymore?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element> I was devastated. I was devastated because not only was I being taken away from the one place that I felt like was a home, as twisted as it was, you know, I was already fully addicted to this person. This was a man that pleased me on a level I had never been pleased, and also you know was giving me this attention, and what was I going to do without him? You know, it was a total setup for the rest of, you know, my relationships. And so when I found, you know, when I found out we were moving I was devastated. And when we did move I just flipped out, you know, and I remembered when things started changing for the worse because I made him a necklace and I sent it to him and I called him and I said, “Hey, did you get the necklace?” and he said, “Oh, yeah, your cute little necklace. Yeah, it broke in the mail.” You know, and I realized at that point he was treating me like a kid, because he hadn’t treated me like a kid before.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element> Because he wanted something from you.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element> Yeah. And so I started—I felt so out of control of the situation. And I tried to regain control the only way I could, which was I told a friend of my mother’s how upset I was. You know, when the friend of your mother’s is a heroin addict …</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>  Always the best person to go to.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element> Always, always.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element> For one, you know that they’re going to react calmly.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element> You know, I mean like not a good person to keep a secret. So she goes to my mother and then it becomes like a domino affect. My mother calls California. I’m finding out—and I’m just finding things out through hearsay. I’m afraid to ask anyone, you know, all of the sudden my mother is just so upset. My mother is like, “How could this happen? How could you do this to my baby?” You know, all these things, and in my opinion it was just like this embarrassment, how could people find out you know, that I had fucked up as a mother. What I’m hearing from the grapevine is that this person, this man that I had been involved with not only got his ass royally kicked by all of the instructors, but lost his house, lost his job, I’m not sure why charges weren’t pressed, I’m really not sure. But I was just, there was nothing I could do. And I felt completely powerless and devastated and no one wanted to speak with me again, no one from that entire place and that was crushing because that was the only connection that I had ever really made and so what I basically learned—</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>Why would they punish you?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element> Because I was trouble. I was now labeled as trouble, you know. And, yeah, it really sucked, because I really cared for these people, but they—I was branded. And I didn’t hear anything for years, a couple of years went by and then I got—my mother came up to me with the phone one night and said, “You better not fucking lie to them.” And I said, “Who?” I answered the phone and it was the California Highway Police and this—the police were calling to confirm that this guy had molested me and I was like, “What? Whoa? What’s going on here?” And he was applying for a California Highway Police job. So apparently it’s somewhere in the books, and you know, I felt like I had ruined his life twice. It was like re-traumatizing you know and nowhere in there was there really support for me, you know, I’m trying to make sure everyone else is fine, so you know, I tell these stories and I don’t want to sound like a super victim because I don’t really feel like a victim anymore, but it does sound kind of shitty these things.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>It’s like nobody ever took that little twelve year old girl aside and said, you know, “Let’s talk about what you’re feeling, let’s talk about, you know, how desperately you want attention, and let’s show her that there are healthy ways for a 12-year-old girl to get attention. And let’s see that she has an outlet for her feelings and her creativities and her desires so that she doesn’t have to confuse an adult who is probably as confused and as fucked up as she is.”</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element> Well what I think it did was set this perfect template of, ok, so from now on my sexuality and my dating is going to be secret, I’m not gonna tell anyone. They’re gonna continue to be older because I’m gonna try and relive this situation and make it work out for me, you know, but also reliving the situation of my father sending me away, like changing that, fixing that, like, pick me instead of my stepmother, you know, like. So I mean just this deep template being set down and then the second part of the story is, you know, after—flash forward, I’m 28 years old and in San Francisco because I’m applying to graduate schools for therapy, marriage and family therapy, and I’m with my aunts, a couple of my aunts who, you know, over my adulthood, they’ve become my real core, you know, of family, and we’re in a San Francisco supermarket and I walk in and I turn my head to the right and I see the back of this man’s head and there is a scar on it, and the shape of the head and the shape of the hair, and I realize it’s the man, the karate guy that I was involved with when I was 12.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>And that phrase “involved with” makes me so want to find a different phrase than that.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element> I know, I know, I know, because—well the thing is, if I say “the man that molested me” I’m immediately a victim, he takes 100% of the blame, and the truth is I fully believe that I had a part in it. I don’t believe it was a bigger part, I don’t believe that, you know—I believe that it was an involvement.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element> And, while I’m sorry that you had to go through all of this stuff, I’m so glad that you could share this story with us because I stress many times on the podcast that most of the stuff that fucks us up is stuff that’s in a gray area and can’t be black and white. And most of our life is spent trying to sort through that gray area, wanting to know where the truth is, wanting some type of catharsis and sometimes it’s really hard with stuff that’s in the gray area and this is a perfect example where it’s …</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element> Well I don’t think it’s socially acceptable to say that I had a part in it, you know, and it really rubs people the wrong way to say that I was fully aware of what I was doing and, you know, the truth is he still had the responsibility of stopping the situation.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element> And I have to say Jess I don’t think you were fully aware of what you were doing. I think you were fully aware of the game you were playing, but you weren’t aware of the repercussions of the game you were playing.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element> Ok, that’s a good clarification. I agree with that clarification. But, yeah, you know, I mean, I think that, you know, to become a full victim is to be able to not be able to get out of it, you know, to not be able to work through the issue and I’m not a full victim, you know and I felt awful about what happened to him. And I still do to a certain extent—I don’t feel that awful but I feel, you know, I feel sad for him.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>So ….</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">J:</element>Back to the story. So I see the back of his head and I know immediately it’s him, immediately. Like my whole body froze, right there next to the vegetables, like just absolutely.

      <h2> Why do some people enjoy physical pain or become aroused by it? For Kal, the discovery came with a lot of complications; he was a young boy and it was at the hands of a powerful and sadistic pedophile Rabbi (Heshy Brier) who is now a fugitive living in Israel. Kal shares about his years of self-destruction and bottoming out before eventually getting sober and starting the process of healing and advocating for other survivors. </h2>

      <p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element>So I was a kid, I can't remember at what age, when I was recommended to go see a doctor for medication for depression and for acting out and for, think of like a soul who just grew up wanting to explore the world, wanting to be free, wanting to be able to ask questions, be able to explore, be able to just be me, and all through my childhood I was being stifled more and more.

So I almost feel, when I look back at my life, I kind of feel God had a sense of humor and just by mistake threw me into the wrong group of people. I didn't belong there.

So, as I was growing up, I have tons of siblings. I am, I didn't particularly feel very close to my parents. I used to joke, and I know it sounds a bit harsh, but the only time I knew my father really intimately was when he was beating me and I was laying in my own blood. Now, that wasn't regularly and he's not a rageful person and he was just a very, very pious, very disciplined person, but just the way he dealt with disciplining me was not a very particular effective way and was mostly beating us.</p>

 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Did you get the feeling that it was his belief that the harder he beat you the better it would work, or that he was also letting some of his personal anger out?</p>

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Well, I have to believe that was letting some of his anger out, but--</p>

 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Why do you have to believe that?</p>

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Because he, if he didn't have pent-up stuff, then I would think dialogue would be more of a natural--</p>

 

[Chuckling]

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> --more of a natural way of wanting to communicate, hey, you should be hanging out there, not with older boys or not in dark rooms or like--</p>

 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> [Chuckles]</p>

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> --he once found me in a room, rather like, hey, what's going on with you, are you feeling left out, like is there any way that you want to be seen that you're not being seen or you're not being appreciated, whatever healthy communication would come in, it wasn't that. It was more like, you should not have done it and now you're going to be beaten for it.

But sexual abuse started coming into my life around age eight and nine by the right-hand person of the Square rebbe. So think of where he lives and, right next to the temple, and they drive cars with sirens and lights, and it's almost like a police force of security. Whenever he would drive somewhere, they were always like flying with lights and sirens. And there were many times when Square rebbe would fly somewhere, literally where highways would be blocked off in order for him to be able, like you see these people like as above the law.</p>

 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Yeah.</p>

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Like they are not, like--</p>

 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> He was your--</p>

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> --they don't sit in traffic. They fly like, the particular rules that other people have to obey by doesn't exist. Like he meets with presidents. He meets with governors. Like it's not, so his right-hand person is somebody who is really, really powerful. Growing up in that community, those are people that you look up to.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> He's your community's Jerry Sandusky.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> I don't even know who that is, but--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> He was a pedophile who--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Oh, God.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> --was on the football coaching team of Penn State--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Oh, I was just going to say that, yeah.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> --and he used his access to do that, and a lot of people looked the other way because they didn't want to draw attention to it because it might put the program at risk.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> So that was exactly that. I mean, I remember as a kid walking into his office, and he would open the safe and I remember seeing stacks of cash. I mean, think about it. The Square rebbe sits in his office, sits in his, in this holy, beautiful, regal room, when he sees people from all over the world that come to get his blessing. A part of doing that is they give him what they call a kritl[sp?], or they'll give him a little paper with the names of your kids, and it's always attached to a $100 bill or a $50 bill or $1,000 or like, every single human being that goes in to see the Square rebbe goes in to see them with a note and cash.

So that's just how they do it. That's just the way of giving back. It's a way of supporting the leadership. It's a part of you give something of you and now, then he blesses you with like, it's kind of like when you look at the rebbe, there's rebbe and then there's like a clear path to the creator of the universe and all the requests and desires and aspirations and people being sick or life decisions, you go, he looks at this piece of sheet and he kind of like goes into this trance, and then he starts praying with you and he gives you directions and gives different blessings, and it's always with cash. So--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> And can you hear the cash register over the blessings?</p>


 

[Chuckling]

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> No, you just see a stack of little papers with cash on his table and then it would be taken away.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Now, why would people from outside the community be coming in there? Are there--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> So there's outside, so the Square Hasidim, as in, people that belong to that sect that live in Borough Park, that live in Flatbush, that live in Williamsburg, that live in Israel, in London, in Antwerp, like all over the world there are Hasidic families that, for lack of a better word, that--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> This is the Vatican for their sect--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Exactly, exactly. Basically they are, what's the word I'm looking for? Their allegiance to, or what's the word I'm looking for . . .</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> What's the, generally the, roughly the world population that adheres to that sect?</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> I don't, I don't really know. I can't really answer that question.

So I would come into his right-hand person's office, and there's literally just stacks of cash. I mean, they will go to their respective places. But I was one of those kids that would walk out of the office with hundreds of dollars in my pocket.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Because you stole them or he gave them to you?</p>


 

<p class="guest"><element class="speaker">K:</element> Because he gave them to me--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> To keep quiet?</p>


 

<p class="guest"><element class="speaker">K:</element> He would touch me inappropriately many times. There was this ongoing insane relationship of me asking him for money, and him having access to me. Now, I saw lots of kids my age and a bit older that were always going in and out of his office, and you could never tell why, although there's cameras everywhere and everything is being recorded, but there could be a million different reasons why I would be there.

My grandmother might have sent me to go pick something up, or my mother who's involved in helping the community in another particular way he's asking a question or, I mean, there's, everything is so intertwined. So, me not feeling always very comfortable at home, me feeling always pressured in the community for many reasons, me being out late before different holidays or before, like when the Square rebbe, one of his kids or grandkids will get married, it's like the Super Bowl. I mean, there's lights and they're building bleachers and signs, and it's, like there's always something going on in that community that was this big-deal celebration.

But he had, now years later I know, he had years and years and years of history of abusing kids. Now, when I got sober at 18 and I started going through my own process of recovery and confronting a lot of, all of the crap that I went through as a kid and having left that community and, I mean, leading up, before 18, it was just rage and anger and, I mean, it was a community that just got away with anything.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> I can't imagine how much rage and oppression and confusion you must have felt. How did he pre-, I’m always interested to know the manner in which perpetrators present it, spin it, whatever.</p>


 

<p class="guest"><element class="speaker">K:</element> It's such a, it's such a bizarre topic because there are so many factors at play. So even being my age, being who he was, he had no right to ever take me outside of the community. You know, like he knows the rules.

Like, yes, maybe I was helping build something or maybe I was helping with organizing something, which I was many times all through like nine, 10, 11, 12, but, so I remember when I was fairly young, and I don't remember the exact age, we would drive outside of the community. He would take me into this building called the Refuah Health Center, which is kind of like, it's not a hospital but it's a medical center, which serves for a lot of people outside of the community but also most of our community uses that.

And I remember distinctly one particular time where it wasn't even, we never, maybe we did. I haven't thought of like the actual sensation in the communications of, what words were exchanged that had the understanding that I was going to get in the car, supposedly by my choice, and then drive outside of the community.

And it was, obviously it was so significant. Like I'm sitting in this like, this car that has all the lights and sirens and all the gadgets, and it's this really important--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Which I am sure in his mind was leverage for--</p>


 

<p class="guest"><element class="speaker">K:</element> Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. But it wasn't like, oh, we were going to go to the 7-Eleven. There is no 7-Eleven around there, and 3:00 in the morning, you shouldn't be driving out with a kid outside of the community.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> And did anybody know that you were with him?</p>


 

<p class="guest">
<element class="speaker">K:</element> No, no.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> And how many times had you been outside the community? How many times would an average kid who was born there and is 11 have seen outside the walls?</p>


 

<p class="guest">
<element class="speaker">K:</element> It's hard to tell. Most kids that age have never left that community, unless, if you were a family like us, like we would go away for the summers. We would have, we would go to Muncie. Like me and my family, we have been outside of the community. Not, as a kid, I wouldn't go by myself, but I have been out of the community with my family. But there's a lot of kids at that age that have never left. They don't even go away for camp. Like, that's the community and the world they live in.

But I, the moment, the most significant moment of this particular story is walking into that building and remembering, like he would, he undid the alarm of the building, and this building is like, what, I don't know, a five-story building or four-story building, massive, in my head, being this little kid, and then the door locking behind me and that chill, like the entire hallway walking into the building is dark.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Wow.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> And it's probably around 3:00 in the morning, and the door is closing, the metal door is closing behind me, and him turning the alarm on again, which means we would have to go up to the next floor before the alarm would turn off. And that just, the paradox of sheer terror of, I can be killed, I can be chopped dup, I can be raped, I can be beaten, there's nowhere to go, that door is locked. It's the middle of the night, and I'm supposed, like he's not pulling me in there, but there's, I've gotten to know a very interesting victimization trance, and I'll tell you another story in a minute--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> What a perfect word to describe it.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> --that it's not violent. It's not coercion. But it's almost magnifying beyond choice.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> There's like a freeze that takes place in the victim that--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Another option isn't an option. Like, I could have ran away. No one, there was no barriers, there was no, and that, I've studied that. You know, even, and then going upstairs and then bending over one of the doctor's tables and then him taking off his belt and me negotiating with him, if he was going to beat me with his hands, with his belt or with a stick and that will determine how much money he would give me.

Like, even that--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> So this, so the, in addition to him raping you, he was also beating you.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> So, rape didn’t happen in that particular story. It would be more fondling and touching and, it was never violent rape. But how, a part of his perversion, how he would engage touching me--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Please apologize to him, by the way, for me assuming that he rapes.

 

[Chuckling]

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Although I wouldn't be very, I wouldn't, yeah--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> If I didn't know you, Kal, I wouldn't have made that joke.</p>


 

[Chuckling]

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> It's all good, absolutely. But what I want to say is that the moment of when that door closed behind me is more embedded in my brain and my brain cell, in my nervous system, than the interaction that happened afterwards.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> You know, that makes perfect sense to me because when the kid is experiencing the sexual abuse, they are generally leaving their body. They are dissociating. They're going to a place that isn't there partially, you know what I mean.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yeah.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Whereas leading up to it, I would imagine you're a little bit more in your body, and that's like one of the most chilling metaphors I've ever heard for experiencing sexual abuse--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yeah, I want to jump ahead because if anyone listened to this, there'll be like the sequence of being able to identify this particular phenomenon.

I remember around that time in my life, again, most people that are in arranged marriages, their siblings are getting married. Most kids in that community, people are marrying people in that community.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Mm-hmm.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Only when a kid is a bit troubled or if a kid is a bit more modern, a bit more rebellious, they will still marry into a Hasidic family but from a family outside of the community. So whenever you do that, just like a note to self, whenever someone is marrying outside of the community, it's less of an ideal marriage.

So my oldest brother had his own issues and his own problems, I won't go into detail, but he was marrying somebody from outside of the community, so our entire family was in Borough Park for the weekend, the weekend after he got married.

So I'll give you another visual. There's this huge building, obviously I went back years later and it's not that, it's not as big, but as a kid, it's around, sometimes in the afternoon, really hot outside in the summer, Brooklyn, New York, and we had spent the whole afternoon at the family's home and, which was really lovely. We came for, you know, Jews, they do that three different prayers in a day, and so it was close to Minchah, and we are in this synagogue and if the door was over there, I was standing next to two adults and they were talking to each other and all of a sudden--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Kal was pointing to his right--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Like the far right, and I'm literally looking northwest, and if you're looking, southeast is where the door was.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Mm-hmm.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> And, you know, we had just arrived there, nothing in particular was going on in the building, and all of a sudden my entire body flipped around, like literally someone was pulling my hair chest to four doors right next to each other, and towards the end the door was open probably a foot and a half, and a guy standing there with a lollipop and showing me to come.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> What [incredulously]?</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> There's no better way of descriptions. It's exactly how it happened. I'm doing my thing, standing there next to a few adults, and all of a sudden my whole body turns and I see this guy with a lollipop and all of a sudden I felt, I literally felt like he was pulling me through thin air to follow him.

I go through that door. I walk down three staircases. And he pushes me into the corner and starts pulling down my pants and, all of a sudden, I came to, pushed him away, ran upstairs, I'm out of breath and I'm almost like skipping over the stairs, run back to where I was standing before, and the few adults, they look down at me and they go, it was almost like they had, I had no idea how long that took. It could have been a second. It could have been two minutes. It could have been a half an hour. Time didn't exist.

And one of the reasons why I, when I tell that story, it's kind of like I had this invisible sign on my forehead that said fuck me, and that's the relationship between pedophiles and victims that I was always fascinated by. There is something in the victimization that victims take comfort in, and almost in the re-victimization of abuse.

Now, I don't understand and I have not studied that extensively. I did run a non-profit for the prevention of childhood sexual abuse. I did meet with a lot of offenders and victims.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> By that do you mean the act of it or falling under the spell of--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Falling under the spell.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Okay, good, because I want to clearly delineate between that. And I believe it's something that abusers, all abusers, be it physical abusers--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> It's like, how do you find out of 10 people who you're going to be able to dominate that way.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> I think people see it in the eyes. I think they see a hesitation in the eyes and a desire to please. Almost every person that I, well, or I should say many, many people that I have met who have been victimized, there is a desire to please that they see, I don't know, I suppose an innocence. And is it conscious in the person that does it?</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> I don't think so.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Do they think this person's not going to talk, I can manipulate this person? Or--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> I think that's a byproduct, but I think before any verbal communication, body language might be a part of it, but there is, I think there's an energetic, invisible dynamic that plays out.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> I think you're right, because often you'll hear people, you know, a woman will share about being at a party and then all of a sudden from across the room the guy who is will then abuse her for the next five years, their eyes meet and they don't see anybody else.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> So, I mean, on a more--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> I just want to make sure that people who have been victims don't think that we are victim-blaming. That's what I want to be clear about--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> No. I don't think it's consciously called, you don't ask for it. I mean, no.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> But even if you did, that's your experience--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> No amount of abuse, yeah, no amount of abuse can ever be justified. And the fact, if abuse happened again, it is the responsibility of the abuser for doing what he did.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Even if the child asks for it--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> But it goes even further for victims, I believe. There is an identity that gets built around victimization, and that's certainly as you grow up. You know, when I started going through my own recovery and I started looking at my own actions, there is--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> And self-beliefs.
</p>

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right. Belief systems, like what was making up this dysfunctional life of mine, and we can talk about in a moment how that came about, but there is, there's a benefit that I, there's a benefit and a comfort for being locked in, in a victim identity, as in, one, I know how it feels, two, I know how to maneuver around it. Like we, as human beings, I believe that we build entire self-image based on victimization.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Because at the time we believe it to be true, we believe that to be our worth, and so then we can navigate it because there's no unknown.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right, right. I mean, in mental health, you see that a lot. I mean, why do people that are being physically abused stay with their abuser? I mean, it's rather to stay, rather than going through so much discomfort and even terror that is predicted than the unknown that is not predicted.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> And the same reason why the alcoholic or drug addict will continue to risk their life and everything they hold dear to get loaded because the idea of trying a life without it is more terrifying.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> I might die or I might have to start going to support groups, you know, I'm going to have to get back to you.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right [chuckles]. I got to consider my options.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Yes. So, go ahead.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yeah. So that was, you know, I left the community when I was around 11 years old, and again, that's usually where I pause.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Hold that thought for one second. We'll come back to it. The thing with the lollipop--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yeah.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> --and by the way, congrats, first stereotypical lollipop moment, six years of doing the podcast. I'm going to see if I can make you a trophy.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> [Chuckles]</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> I think we had a van in the second year of the podcast, somebody whose perpetrator drove a van. But the lollipop incident, was that with a different person and was that before or after the encounters with the second-in-command guy.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> I don't actually remember.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Okay.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> It was definitely not the same person, but I can't remember which one was first. The guy at second in command, with him it happened quite a few times, but I don't remember which one happened first.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> What do you remember thinking or feeling from the moment you would feel that you had no choice in going someplace with this person, through the event to sometime maybe the next day or that night or after you got dropped off or whatever?</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> So here, here's an interesting spin on talking about sexual abuse. I didn't even talk about those experiences as sexual abuse until around 18.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Most people don't. Most people--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Most people don't because maybe you don't want to put a name on abuse.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Or you don't think it was abuse.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> You think that you had a choice because you didn't fight or a part of it felt good or you felt sorry for that person or whatever.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> But most of those experiences with him almost felt like I had more control, so there's a very, there's a few very distinct . . . I mean, like if I was an adult and I’m looking at a little kid and the kid is really confused and the kid is like, feels taken advantage of, like obviously I'll look at him and be like, you're a kid. Like, regardless of what was going through your brain or your mind, it's not relevant. He's an adult. You're a kid. You should know love, security, predictability, healthy environments. Any adult that breaks that should be thrown off a building, for lack of a better word.

Like, if I'm looking at it as black and white, I go, no, you as a kid, you are, you come into the world, what you should know is safety. What you should know is security. So when you go into the big, crazy adult world, you can start adapting to the lack of security and predictability in a healthy way.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Yeah.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> But first you should have security.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> So you know what it feels like.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> So you'll know when you don't have it--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right [chuckles].</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> --that something needs to change.
</p>

 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> So I get intellectually that there is, yes, I get that, and the peak turn-on and the peak vibrancy and the peak aliveness of my nervous system growing up was in those moments. And that's what I almost looked for for the rest of my life.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> The adrenaline.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> The adrenaline, those peak experiences. So that moment where I could die or I can be really amused is [chuckles], is an edge that has stayed with me and I've kind of had to learn through meditation and through many other practices to get used to the not-so-peak experiences.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> What do you mean when you say, or I could be amused?</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Or I can be amused. Or the worst won't happen. Either the worst will happen, or it will be entertaining or it would be, I mean--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> When you're being abused, it would be--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> So, when I was laying in that, when I was laying in that bed in the doctor's office, bent over, being beaten in a way that almost was unbearable, there was something about that experience that had me feel amusement.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Really.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yeah. There was something about that experience that had me be, had me feel more alive than my boring, day-to-day life.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Wow.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> So, the reason why I didn't call that abuse is because it didn't feel, well, violating a little bit, but it didn't feel--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Like it was 100--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> --like I was being taken advantage of. It felt like I was relevant and significant to someone, important, while feeling really, really high sensation. Now, feeling high sensation is fairly neutral. The younger the child and the higher the sensation could be traumatizing for the nervous system, not even as an intellectual thing, but just for the nervous system being like, no, now it should know safety, it should know fight or flight shouldn't be happening right now [chuckles].</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Right. And if you can't flee, that's usually when--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> --dissociation does what it's supposed to do, which is your brain flees.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right. So this is where my experience has very frequently differed, and when I go back into my experiences and I talk to other victims, you know, most victims, or a lot, a lot of victims, definition of their victim means that they have been violated. There's something that happened to them that they, in their right mind, would not want to have happen to them. They were touched in a particular way, hurt in a particular way. It confuses them, and the scars stay inside them. And I always felt that the trauma, for lack of a better word, that I went through was educational in one way, introduced me to different domains of my own personal life and my own personal experience that I would not have gotten if I was just a normal child, treated normally.

So I only started using abuse when I started encountering other victims from this community and from victims that I know who were victimized by him, that his interactions with them were a lot more crazy and more abusive. And so I, so yeah, it's an interesting topic.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> What do you mean, it introduced you to areas of your life that, help me understand the parts of it that you--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> What I mean by those other aspects of my life?</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Yeah, the positives. Help me understand, or at least for a portion of time in your life that you saw as positive. I assume you, do you still feel that there were positive things that came out of it for you personally?</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yeah.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Okay. Help me understand those, because I think right now the listener is going--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Is going, what about that could be positive--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Exactly.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Okay. The way I used to describe it to people is like, as a kid you grow up and there's like a little faucet that eventually, this thing called sexuality, and at different stages in one's life, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, that faucet kind of gets opened naturally in a particular rate.

Now, what happened to me is that someone opened that faucet really fast at a younger age.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Because it was just by its nature such sensory overload--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right, right.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> --emotionally and physically.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> But that sensation was, it is and was within my capacity of feeling as a human. So, and here's a completely different topic, and then I'll come back to this for a second, when I went through a ton of different conferences on sexual abuse and pedophilia and trying to understand that whole dynamic, I remember learning the implications of abuse is a lot harsher, past abuse, than the actual abuse--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Oh, I definitely, definitely believe that--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> --meaning the shame, the integration, all that, that the experience in and of itself that we call the abuse, or that was actually abuse, is more neutral.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> And it's a drop in the bucket generally in terms of the ripples. The ripples are the part that--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Exactly.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> --hurt your life.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> You can't, you're not sharing it with anybody. You're afraid. You're ashamed. Or it felt really good and you don't really know where to place it.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> You don't trust people.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Right. So not all abuse is, you took something really hard, something really big into a small hole and you, and there's blood and there's viol-, not, yes, that happens and it's so insanely unfortunate, but a lot of the times it happens, you are coddled. You are pursued. You are--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Made to feel powerful.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> --manipulated. You are made to feel special, powerful and so on. And so, for me, yes, I was made to feel special, yes, I was rewarded, yes, I was given props to even come back for it again, but I was introduced to, I think, the world of BDSM at a very young age. I felt more powerful being submissive. The high-sensation points of abuse was kind of pleasurable.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Mm-hmm.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> I would venture to say, as an adult who is being beaten with a stick or with a cane or with a whip and can hardly sit had the same sensations and the same experiences that I did when I was eight, nine years old. Well, granted, well, if it was my child, I would want to rip that person apart, but given that it was me, and now looking to my experience from my adulthood, I don't see it as abuse.

So I've always seen myself as privileged in the sense that this thing that we call resilience, that most psychologists and psychiatrists could never give me a correct answer on what that actually is, but I would assume that it's very similar of a word than like what is a spiritual experience. Well, we can give you some parameters and it translates to different people differently, but I feel once I started dealing with my own, with forgiveness around the anger, and the anger was not so much that experience. The anger was so much, was more about being abandoned, not being understood, and naturally so.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> By your parents.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> By my parents, by the community, as in, I wasn't looked after. I wasn't, when I started questioning the leadership in the community, when I started telling other people about what had happened, when I started talking to other kids who I saw leave his office, I was the one who was being punished or like they just wanted to do away with me.

So the way they dealt with me was to take me out of the community and place me with a family in Brooklyn.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Instead of confronting that guy.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Exactly.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> When the child goes to a parent or a trusted adult and tells them what happened and nothing is done, or the child is shamed or some other negative thing, people say that that was often more traumatic than the events themselves.

And two things that strike me. Number one is, you know, if you've ever heard a dominatrix interviewed, one of the things they'll say is most of their submissive clients are people who are powerful in their everyday life.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yeah.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> And the second thing, when you were talking about the nervous system kind of expanding, that faucet widening, is it reminds me of almost exactly what war veterans describe, that when they come home it, they miss that rush, even though they don't want to see their buddy get killed, the intense, they miss the intensity of it because they've never felt more alive.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yeah, let's get back to that, because I derailed with that.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> One of my guests, Jesse Perez, in his episode, he was a gang member, and he said the greatest high I've ever had was being shot at.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yeah. You can't, there's no option to get distracted. There's no option to, like I'm the guy, I remember being part of this organization in San Francisco a couple years ago, and one day we found out that somebody had just shot herself, and the entire room was freaking out and I just get crystal clear, focused, you do this, you do that, sit down, take some water, shut up, call this person, and I saw the same thing when bombs were exploding in Israel. Like, there was a suicide bomb once, I was downtown. Everyone is running away, including my ex-wife, and I am running toward it. Like there is--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Things slow down for you.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> It goes back to that experience, but coming back to that analogy of, so I feel like maybe I was traumatized, maybe I was privileged, regardless of the label of was it right or was it wrong. I was just introduced to higher levels of sensation. Now when--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Are you saying that you can't clearly label it wrong, or you're saying whether or not I've benefited from that door being opened in my--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> I absolutely can label it wrong from the perpetrator.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Right.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Meaning, he was an adult, I was a kid. That is black and white. Interpreting my experience, I don't feel victimized. I feel--</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Do you realize how crazy that sounds, though?</p>


 

[Chuckling]

 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Because I--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Oh, yeah, because I've sat around victims, I've cried with hundreds of victims and I've listened to insane stories all through my life.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> And I'm not, clearly not calling you crazy.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yes [chuckles].</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> I just, my purpose with this podcast is to help people with different experiences understand ourselves and other people, and so I want what you're sharing, since it, not a lot of people speak about it as candidly as you do or have the experience that you do, I want to make sure that we're not being fuzzy in some of the things that we describe.</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Yeah.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Are you saying that the overall net was a positive for you or that just by having some things come out of it that you use in your daily life it doesn't feel like the typical victim scenario?</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> I mean, it's a really good question because I haven't thought of it for a very long time, and now when I'm thinking back before age 18, so when it all fell apart [chuckles], when this rageful, angry, full-of-resentment drug addict of a kid was coming, crashing down, I remember sitting with this rabbi once in Brooklyn he's telling me, I'm telling him some of my stories, he's telling me some of his stories, and he was also a survivor.

And I remember having this cathartic moment of, how are you so affectionate or how are you so caring? I remember looking at him and being like, you are representing of that community but, in the same time, you're representing care and compassion to what I went through. And I remember my brain kind of short circuiting.

So for me to say that I've always believed that my experience growing up was a positive would be a lie, because all through my teens I was, I used to envision taking a gun and shooting that guy. I used to, I was rageful against that culture, so I can't say I was like, it helped me come to be this healthy, good human being [chuckles]. But it's very interesting even now, sitting right here, like thinking about how disturbing that experience was up to 18 and now there's not a conscious cell in my body that sees that experience as negative.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> No part of it is negative?</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> No.</p>


 

<p class="paul">
<element class="speaker">P:</element> Other than the fact that this guy is still--</p>


 

<p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">K:</element> Other than the fact that he's still not in prison and his son is married to my younger sister.</p>
