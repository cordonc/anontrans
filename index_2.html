      <h1> Interview with Sophie </h1>
      <h2> The 27 year-old listener discusses hearing voices, dealing with Borderline Personality disorder and/or Bipolar II, hypomania as well as the abusive “relationship” she had with a 22 year-old when she was 12 and how she began self-harming then. </h2>

      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">Paul:</element>One of the things that I like to talk about, if you're comfortable talking about it, is the manner in which these predators get their way. What they say, how they act, how they groom people. I want to understand more of how they get away with it. I guess in the hopes that someday maybe there can be a telltale warning signs that we can share with children, beware if this starts happening. If this happens, this is not okay, even though it may be exciting to you. Are you comfortable talking about the details?</p>
      <p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">Sophie:</element>Yea, so it started off in this theater arts troupe and when you do like a theater production, everyone gets really close really fast. You're working together like everyday.</p>
       <p class="paul">
          <element class="speaker">P:</element>And it's exciting and the bonding is like you being yourself and you're letting your freak flag fly, you're being expressive, you're not being judged.</p>
      <p class="guest">
        <element class="speaker">S:</element> Yea, so after, I mean we all felt really close to each other, but it wasn't a real closeness, because it's not something you build up overtime it's kind of superficial, but I was feeling comfortable with everyone and I sort of admired him anyway and we exchanged screen names, this is back in the day when you do the AOL instant messenger and so we started talking online and I felt safe with him and he treated me like an equal. Like he didn't treat me like a child and I think that's something that people, children need to look out for and it's hard to recognize because you want to be treated equally when you're young especially when you're around that age, 12 or 13, you want to be treated as an adult.
      </p>
    <p class="paul">
      <element class="speaker">Paul:</element>And to me a red flag right away is somebody having an online relationship with that age difference.</p>
    <p class="guest">
      <element class="speaker">S:</element>Yea and it progressed where we started hanging out one on one and then I would sneak out of my house and he would come pick me up and take me back to his apartment. At the time, I thought it was a real relationship, I know now it wasn't. And even for years after that I always saw it as a great thing, a great experience.</p>
      <p class="paul">
        <element class="speaker">P:</element>You want to be older, it's like 'I'm 12 and a half!'</p>
        <p class="guest">
          <element class="speaker">S:</element>Yea it wasn't until my early twenties that I came to terms with the fact that it was sexual abuse, it was child abuse and it was something that was very harmful to me.</p>
      <p class="paul">
          <element class="speaker">P:</element>Was it when you became his age that you could see it?</p>
      <p class="guest">
          <element class="speaker">S:</element>Yea, I think so, cause I started to realized, woah imagine me, you know, getting into some situation with a 12 year old boy, like that just seems terrible.</p>
      <p class="paul"> <element class="speaker">P:</element>What did you feel or think when that moment hit you?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Um, I felt really like, I felt like I was taken advantage of, like obviously I was physically taken advantage of, but I felt like everything I had thought about who I was, like I was an adult and I was sophisticated, it was all a lie. And it really sort of cut me down to size.</p>
      <p class="paul"> <element class="speaker">P:</element>I think that's what hurts the most about sexual abuse, is the being tricked.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Yea and it's hard now, because if I met him today, if I saw him today, I don't know if I'd punch him in the face or hug him. You know, there's still that part of me that remembers thinking that I was totally in love with him, so that's really hard to deal with, knowing it was abuse and still having that tenderness for him. You know it's really shocking and upsetting to me.</p>
      <p class="paul"> <element class="speaker">P:</element>Thank you for sharing that part of it, because I think that's one of the most difficult things in confronting the abuse that happened to you, to us, is that its so complicated because there are often positive feelings towards the abuser and you feel like you're throwing them under the bus to call them a predator or whatever. Because we do often see that humanity, but then we also think to ourselves, was it all an act? But my thought is that, I don't think there can be genuine tenderness between somebody who is in the state of abusing somebody, to me it all falls under the heading of grooming and mind control. I think.. I don't know that's just my personal opinion, but getting back to the time that you spent with him, like what would he say to you to introduce the physical aspect?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Well, I think and this is something that's really difficult for me to swallow, is that I think I instigated it. If he was so smart grooming me that you know I thought I was in charge of the situation and then we started talking online and I don't remember if I brought it up or if he brought it up, like 'oh, come pick me up.'</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>Trust me, trust me. He was grooming you, this was him, from the moment that he began an email relationship with you that was beyond maybe just 'hey I'm having trouble with this part, can I email you?' 'yea sure' you know, like I get emails sometimes from girls who are 15 years old and they're like 'I'm cutting, I don't know what to do' Well clearly, I'm going to email them back and say go see a therapist or whatever, but I think there's a qualification to a relationship with somebody who is age inappropriate on the internet and to me it just sounds like this guy, right out of the gate, he knew what he wanted. Who was the one who suggested that you started corresponding via email?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>I don't remember.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>Okay, anyway, you remember that you initiated that you wanted to take it further, and I hope you don't blame yourself for that, because it's up to the adult to know what is appropriate.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Yea, I mean, it's just hard to swallow, it's hard to wrap my head around and it's hard for me to understand because I have great male role models, I was never abused by anyone else like physically or emotionally, so it just came out of no where and that's something thats really hard to deal with. Like, where did this come from, how is it so easy for me to be preyed upon?</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>I'm glad you shared that, because I know there are so many listeners that are feeling and thinking that same thing, so then they want to go to the place 'well I must be inherently bad' or perverted, or I hate the word “slutty” or they wanted that and it breaks my heart to think that somebody is putting any of the blame on themselves. Where are you today with that thing, have you let go of the shame and the blame?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Um, intellectually I have, like I understand now that I was so young and I was being manipulated and that, you know, I don't understand why I did it, but it happened. But emotionally, I still hang on to that and I still feel shame and thats hard to get over.</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker">P:</element>But the fact that you say, why I did it.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>What do you mean?</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker>">P:</element>You're inferring that it was your decision.</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>Oh, right. Like that I had the power?</p>
      <p class="paul"><element class="speaker>">P:</element>Yea and thats the part of the sick genius of the predator, is they make you think that you have a choice in this. They sense what you long for as a child and they pervert that need for it, to lure you into what it is that they want from you and they give you the illusion that you wanted it. When what you probably wanted was so much more pure than that. I would imagine, you just wanted the attention from this guy?</p>
      <p class="guest"><element class="speaker">S:</element>I thought that I was totally in love, like I thought it was true love. Like this was the wonderful magical thing.</p>
